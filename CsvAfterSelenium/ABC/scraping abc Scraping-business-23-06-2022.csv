0,Fears grow that many Australians could default on their housing loans,business,"  As fixed mortgages end and rates rise, many risk losing their homes Sarah Ibrahim is worried about what will happen when her fixed rate ends in January. Ms Ibrahim and her partner took on a home loan of more than $1.5 million in Sydney, with a deposit of 10 per cent. They are among almost 40 per cent of Australians with mortgages who have locked in ultra-low fixed rates and will roll off them as soon as next year, and potentially face a world of financial pain. ""We fixed the majority of our mortgage for two years, and we assumed that in the next few years, they wouldn't really go up much,"" Ms Ibrahim told ABC News. She and her husband had been saving for a deposit for years and finally broke into the Sydney property market at the end of 2019. ""It took us years of going to auctions, it took us years of going to inspections, and years of savings, and a lot of bulk shopping and buying second-hand clothes and not buying certain things. Sacrifices were made,"" she said. The couple initially had borrowed with a variable rate, but last year shifted to a part variable rate of 2.75 per cent and part fixed rate of 2.15 per cent to have certainty on ongoing repayments. Ms Ibrahim says she relied on repeated statements from the Reserve Bank that interest rates would not go up until 2024. But now the RBA has stated that the cash rate will lift to 2.5 per cent and possibly more, until it can get inflation down within its target band of 2 to 3 per cent. As interest rates rise, almost 300,000 people who took large and risky home loans during the pandemic could fall into severe financial hardship or even default. For Ms Ibrahim and her family that means a rise of almost $20,000 a year on their mortgage repayments. ""That has been really anxiety-inducing — to think that interest rates will go up by that much and that we would have to try to weather such a large increase at a time when there [are] obviously other upward pressures in relation to the cost of living,"" Ms Ibrahim said. ""It's been really stressful thinking about that and thinking about how we're going to manage such a loan."" For many Australians that stress has already started, with financial counsellors reporting an uptick in banks trying to repossess people's homes because they've been missing mortgage repayments. And economists fear that coupled with higher costs of living, and possible unemployment down the track, the financial system could be at risk. Since moratoriums on mortgage repayments – which were introduced during the pandemic to account for the fact that people had lost or been stood down from their jobs and were not generating enough income – have been lifted, more Australians have been falling behind on their repayments. Stephanie Tonkin, director of mortgage stress at Westjustice, says in the past two months alone the organisation has seen 60 clients and about half of them have been hit with eviction notices. She says they are now trying to negotiate with their lenders for those clients to not lose their homes. ""We're seeing clients coming up to us with a whole range of legal, emotional [and] financial issues, and we are calling on the banks to take a compassionate approach to this real tsunami of home owners who are finding themselves at real risk of homelessness,"" she said. ""We're already seeing banks ramping up their action to enforce mortgage debts and repossess homes already against the background of relatively low interest rates, but with rising cost of living, we're calling on the banks to take a more compassionate approach."" Ms Tonkin notes that many of her clients are still getting back on their feet post COVID. She wants banks to use evictions ""as a last resort"" and be understanding of ""some of the underlying emotional drivers of mortgage stress, be it family violence, gambling, mental ill health"". The desire to make housing more affordable also needs to address the worrying flip side: falling house prices for many Australians. The latest data from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), shows that of $2.2 trillion worth of loans held in March 2022, about $9 billion belonged to borrowers who are 30 to 89 days overdue on their repayments. This is slightly up over the quarter, from $8.4 billion in December 2021, but well down from the $14 billion in March 2019. APRA also provides data on non-performing loans — those that are more than 90 days overdue or where the bank thinks they'll take a loss on the loan. As of March, there was about $10.5 billion in non-performing loans held by owner occupiers, up from $9.6 billion in March 2019. And mortgagees in possession — people whose homes are repossessed by the bank because they have defaulted on their loan — were valued at around $308 million, down from $705 million in March 2019. ABC News also contacted all big four banks – Commonwealth Bank, ANZ, Westpac and National Australia Bank. CBA reported that current home loan arrears are at record low levels of less than 1 per cent and one in two borrowers were three months ahead of their repayments. Westpac said more than two thirds of customers were ahead their mortgage repayments and 90-day delinquencies were less than 1 per cent. NAB said that 70 per cent of its customers were ahead on their mortgage payments but did not indicate default rates. But financial counsellors are worried that with more people coming off fixed rates and variable rates heading above 5 per cent, more people will default on their home loans. Financial Counselling Australia chief executive Fiona Guthrie said ""a lot of people have borrowed to the hilt"" and she is shocked banks have been letting people borrow six or more times their incomes with very low deposits. The number of people who face mortgage stress is still high, but since the regulator introduced tighter lending standards late last year, people borrowing six or more times their income with low deposits is starting to fall. From being smart about shopping for everyday items to making lifestyle changes to save on power, our readers share ways you can cut costs. APRA March 2022 quarter data shows about 23.1 per cent of new mortgages ($32.7 billion worth) had a debt-to-income ratio of six times or more in dollars terms. This was down from the record high of 24.3 per cent (or $40.6 billion) in the previous quarter but still almost triple the rate from March 2019, when it was $11.4 billion. In terms of new home loans written, in March 2022 about $10.5 billion worth had loan-to-value ratio of 90 per cent or above (meaning a deposit of 10 per cent or less was put down). This is slightly down from $13.3 billion in December 2021. Ms Guthrie said they are already seeing signs of people in financial stress and that is set to worsen under higher interest rates. ""We've also got [the cost of] petrol going up, the cost of food going up, the cost of electricity [rising], so all of those factors are playing into what could be quite serious financial problems for a group of people in our community,"" she said. ""People are going to have to tighten their belts, and sometimes quite substantially. And we are particularly worried that for some people, it might be enough to tip them over the edge so that they can't pay their mortgage. While house prices are expected to fall nationally as interest rates continue to rise, that won't necessarily improve affordability. ""For every percentage point increase in interest rates, that will mean more and more people will experience financial stress. And the larger that group of people, the bigger that reverberates through the whole of the economy."" Some people will also be stretched because they already make interest-only repayments rather than any principal off their home loan. These interest-only loans are now a small portion of the $2.2 trillion home loan market — valued at $225 billion, which is down from $405 billion in March 2019 (as that was before APRA introduced tighter lending standards). The big positive for most borrowers is they saved money during pandemic lockdowns, with balances in offset accounts lifting from $162 billion in March 2019 to $228 billion in March this year. Rate City research director Sally Tindall said this total could drop in coming quarters as the RBA continues to hike official rates and people start to dip into their savings to keep up with their growing monthly repayments. But she said most Australian households were well placed to ""take these rate hikes on the chin"" and ""there will not be people just defaulting on their mortgages on mass"". ""However, there will be some people that cannot chart a path through the rising cost of living and the rising cost of mortgage repayments at the same time,"" she said. ""Losing a home … has an everlasting impact on that person's finances."" This week, Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe noted that when the bank signalled interest rates would likely not rise until 2024, it did so under pandemic circumstances, imagining the worst-case scenario. But Mr Lowe said now, with the cost of living in Australia running towards 7 per cent, interest rates will keep rising until inflation falls back within the central bank's target band of 2 to 3 per cent. Ms Guthrie said the Reserve Bank had to take greater care in its messaging. ""There would certainly have been people who would have listened to those predictions [of no rate rises until 2024] and made decisions based on them, and there will be some degree of reckoning for the RBA,"" she said. ""I think it is fair to say that when the Reserve Bank makes quite definite statements about what interest rates are going to do, and when that doesn't happen, they've got a degree of responsibility for that. They need to learn from what looks like quite a serious mistake, that could have quite serious implications for a number of people."" Steven Hamilton, Assistant Professor of Economics at The George Washington University and visiting fellow at the Crawford School at the ANU, said now rates will rise far higher than anyone had anticipated and ""more and more people [will] get close to the edge and get pushed over"". ""The risks are that they go too hard, too fast. And that that leads to an increase in defaults and a really aggressive downturn in the housing market. And I think that does threaten the financial system to some degree,"" he said. Ms Ibrahim said both regulators like the RBA and APRA, as well as lenders, have an obligation to Australians to ensure they do not get false hopes that interest rates will stay low and get over-indebted. ""I definitely took the message [from the RBA] that you can start making plans, knowing that interest rates are going to remain stable and low. This is not just home-loan plans, I mean, business plans based on that. So, it's a really big deal,"" she said. ""And I also appreciate that there's a lot of different variables that the RBA has to consider. But I definitely feel that one of them needs to be highly geared mortgages and people in that situation."" Consumer groups fear that axing safe lending laws during a pandemic could prove risky, fuelling an overheating housing market and leading to a situation where borrowers are saddled with unaffordable mortgages. Ms Ibrahim said while they are middle-class working professionals – she is a lawyer and her husband works in consulting — the couple have two daughters Ameila, 5, and Sophia, 9, and have already had to cut back on essentials to account for the rising cost of living. ""We're [already] thinking about what we buy at the grocery shop … How long do you keep the heater on?"" she said. ""But now we're thinking, what other costs do we have? One of our children is in early childcare, and that's quite expensive. So now we're thinking, 'well, what does that mean for their future'? … This is going to be a lot more stressful. ""There's a lot of middle-class Australia that have really big mortgages. … If [rate hikes are] done really fast, that could see a lot of people … go through mortgage hardship."" Ms Ibrahim said they will do everything they can to hold onto their home, but with such a high loan-to-value ratio (given their low deposit of about 10 per cent), having to sell is a thought that ""crosses our minds"". ""It felt like a huge weight was lifted off our shoulders when we finally got into the Sydney property market. Now it's about how you stay in the market,"" she said.

1,"ASX rises, Wall Street slips as Jerome Powell says US recession is a 'possibility'",business,"  ASX rises, Wall Street slips as Jerome Powell says US recession is a 'possibility' The Australian share market edged slightly higher on Thursday, as gains in financial and tech stocks offset heavy losses across energy and mining companies. The ASX 200 index gained 0.3 per cent, to close at 6,528 points. Some of today's performers were James Hardie (+4pc), Virgin Money UK (+3.2pc), Blackmores (+5.4pc), Metcash (+3.8pc) and Insurance Australia Group (+2.8pc). On the flip side, gold miners St Barbara (-13.5pc), Ramelius Resources (-8.7pc) and Regis Resources (-8.2pc) fell heavily, along with Liontown Resources (-9.3pc), Champion Iron (-8pc) and Novonix (-5.3pc). US markets were weighed down by comments about inflation from Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, who appeared before the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday (local time). He said the Fed was ""strongly committed"" to bringing down inflation, which had reached its highest level in 40 years, while trying not to cause a recession in the process. However, Mr Powell said that achieving a “soft landing” for the US economy would be ""very challenging"". The Fed chair said he believed the US economy is currently strong, but acknowledged that a recession could happen. “It’s not our intended outcome at all, but it’s certainly a possibility,"" he said. ""And, frankly, the events of the last few months around the world have made it more difficult for us to achieve what we want, which is 2 per cent inflation and still a strong labour market.” The United Kingdom is also struggling with the rising cost of living. The latest figures showed that inflation lifted to 9.1 per cent in May — a fresh 40-year high for the British economy. By 4:20pm AEST, the Australian dollar had fallen 0.5 per cent, to 68.9 US cents. That was on top of its 0.6 per cent slide overnight, during the US and European trading session. Philip Lowe has warned Australians they need to be prepared for substantial interest rate rises over the rest of this year, conceding he is not sure how high they might go. The coming sharp slowdown in the world economy will be a weight on the Australian dollar because it is very sensitive to global forces,"" said Commonwealth Bank currency strategist Carol Kong. ""Indeed, our forecast for the Australian dollar to weaken to 62 US cents next year is underpinned by a large expected fall in Australian key commodity prices."" ""We assume commodity prices fall by around 40 per cent at the end of 2023 in line with our commodity analysts' forecasts."" Iron ore tumbled by another 5.8 per cent, to $US109.35 a tonne, according to CBA data. This steelmaking material is Australia's biggest export to China, which is undergoing an economic slowdown. Ms Kong said ""the recent fall in iron ore prices reflects market worries China's pledge to boost infrastructure investment may not materialise given China's zero COVID policy. Investors are trying to assess how far stocks can fall as they weigh risks to the economy, with the US Fed hiking rates to bring down surging inflation. The Australian share market has dropped by more than 15 per cent from its record high, sliding closer towards a bear market. Some investors may be tempted to ""buy the dip"", but analysts say there is ""further downside"" ahead. The S&P 500 earlier this month fell more than 20 per cent from its record high in January, confirming the common definition of a bear market, with the benchmark index last week logging its biggest weekly percentage drop since March 2020. Last week, the ASX 200 also experienced its worst trading week since the initial COVID-19 sell-off. It has fallen by around 15 per cent since its August record high, placing it firmly in correction territory. “Markets continue to be volatile,” Baker Avenue Asset Management's chief strategist in San Francisco, King Lip, said. ""Certainly we are not out of the woods yet … the concerns are still there.” Overnight, the S&P 500 lost 0.1 per cent, to close at 3,760 points. The Nasdaq Composite fell by 0.2 per cent, to 11,053, while the Dow Jones index dropped 0.2 per cent, to 30,483. The three major US indexes spent much of their day in positive territory, before they slipped in the final trading hour. In company news, Moderna shares rose 4.7 per cent, after the company said an updated version of its COVID-19 vaccine generated a strong immune response against fast-spreading Omicron sub-variants. Oil prices tumbled as investors worried that aggressive rate hikes by the US Fed and other central banks could push the global economy into recession, dampening demand for fuel. Brent crude futures plunged by 4.3 per cent, to $US109.74 a barrel, its lowest level in a month. Spot gold rose 0.3 per cent, to $US1,837.53 an ounce. ""Gold edged higher as safe haven buying increased amid recessionary fears,"" ANZ economists Daniel Hynes and Brian Martin wrote in a research note. ""The threat of an economic downturn is likely to provide a floor to gold prices, despite central banks aggressively hiking rates to tame inflation.""

2,Union chief says Reserve Bank in 'boomer fantasy land' over wage-price spiral fears,business,"  ACTU Secretary Sally McManus says Reserve Bank in 'boomer fantasy land' over wage-price spiral fears ACTU Secretary Sally McManus says the Reserve Bank is out of touch and living in ""boomer fantasy land"" if it thinks workers can afford real cuts to their wages. The union boss said the RBA governor Philip Lowe changed his tune in his speech earlier this week about wages. ""He was the one who said that so long as wages keep up with inflation and productivity, they're not inflationary,"" she told RN Breakfast. On Tuesday, Dr Lowe warned pay rises above 3.5 per cent, which is half the 7 per cent inflation forecast by the end of the year, could force the RBA to go harder on interest rates and prolong high inflation. ""Three-and-a-half per cent is kind of the anchoring point that I want people to keep in mind,"" Dr Lowe said in his speech. Last week, the Fair Work Commission lifted the minimum wage by 5.2 per cent, to $21.38 an hour, and workers on award rates will go up 4.6 per cent. This would affect more than 2.7 million workers. The RBA's view on wages growth was backed by Employment Minister Tony Burke that workers might need to take a real wage cut to prevent high inflation. The Reserve Bank Governor expects inflation to crest at 7 per cent by year's end, before gently easing in the new year after a series of interest rate rises. A recession will be avoided and employment will remain strong. At least that's the plan. ""I know that [RBA] board doesn't have anyone there who participates in negotiations for wages or the wage-setting system from the workers side,"" McManus said. ""And that’s a pretty big problem if you’re, you know, making assumptions or trying to understand trying to analyse how things work."" Although Dr Lowe said there were signs of domestic factors contributing to the current high inflation, Ms McManus argued that inflation ""has absolutely nothing to do with wages"". ""We're not achieving 3.5 per cent, let alone 5 per cent, let alone 7 per cent. And so to think somehow that the system is going to deliver across-the-board pay increases of 5 or 7 per cent is boomer fantasy land,"" she said. ""Not realising that whole system would be incapable of delivering that. We do not have centralised bargaining in this country. It would not be possible for that to happen."" The RBA admits it suffered ""reputational damage"" when it tried to wind back its COVID-19 pandemic stimulus program. Ms McManus rejected the warning of a 1970s-style wage-price spiral as a notion used by employers to deny pay increases. ""Nurses and teachers will be pushing to make sure this year that their wages don't go backwards, their wages have gone backwards for years now,"" she said. ""Even the Reserve Bank governor is saying, 'it's fair enough this year or this catch up for what happened during COVID'."" Nurses and midwives across NSW will walk off the job next week in protest of the state government's budget decision of a 3 per cent pay rise for public sector workers.

3,"analysis: The RBA boss has a message, but you might not like it if you have a job",business,"  The RBA boss wants you to follow his path away from recession — even if that means more real wage cuts for workers ""We are not on a preset path,"" Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe observed on Tuesday, in the economic understatement of the week. Indeed, the path ahead looks no more predetermined than it has for the past two-and-a-half years. Since COVID came along, followed by the war in Ukraine, no official forecast has survived more than a few months. The outlook remains uncertain, but Lowe is trying his best to show the way — the path he would like everyone to stick to. The RBA Governor sees the inflation wave cresting at 7 per cent by year's end, before gently easing in the new year after a further series of interest rate rises. A recession will be avoided and employment will remain strong. That's the plan. It involves some pain for mortgage holders along the way, but no economic crisis. Don't panic. And definitely don't do anything unnecessary that could drive inflation even higher and send the economy onto an entirely different path. Lowe has publicly outlined this preferred path scenario twice in two weeks. He's keen to get the message out. Last week he appeared on the ABC's 7:30 program to talk about his chosen course. This week he delivered a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia. He wants everyone to know about the planned path. He is showing the way. And he's warning of the dangers involved if we veer off course and end up somewhere else entirely. To stay on the path, Lowe wants everyone to do their bit. This includes workers who might have hoped for some real wage growth after the election of a Labor government, which campaigned successfully with an argument about ""everything going up except your wages"". Minimum wage earners will see an increase of 5.2 per cent after a decision by the independent umpire last week, something the newly elected government was quick to welcome. This is what life looks like for people in some of the world's most expensive cities where inflation surges are taking hold. The RBA boss, however, doesn't want that repeated across the workforce. Inflation might be headed to 7 per cent, but Lowe is advocating a wage rise of half that amount. ""Three-and-a-half per cent is kind of the anchoring point that I want people to keep in mind,"" he says. In other words, it's a continued real wage cut for most workers in the short term — if we're to stay on Lowe's preferred path. Labor isn't exactly celebrating that suggestion of only modest wage growth, but nor is it disputing the logic of avoiding a wage-price spiral. That would be far worse economically and politically for the Albanese government. But wages aren't the only threat that could see us veer off the path. Government spending is the other risk. So far Treasurer Jim Chalmers appears to be heeding the warnings from the RBA. From July 1, more than $12 billion will be pumped into the economy in the form of turbo-charged Low and Middle Income Tax Offset payments, announced before the election by the Morrison government and promptly backed in by Labor. Beyond that, Chalmers has resisted calls for additional cost of living relief. In fact, he's begun laying the groundwork for cuts, telling the Australian Financial Review on the weekend there was ""a case for a more substantial look"" at spending in his October budget. State governments, however, appear to have missed the memo. On the very day Lowe delivered his speech about the path ahead and repeated his warnings about veering off course, two state Treasurers announced big spending budgets. In NSW, the Coalition government is boosting spending by more than $24 billion over the next four years. Almost half of that, or $10 billion, will flow in the coming 12 months, when the government just happens to be facing an election. The spending, to be clear, is not all bad or necessarily inflationary. New childcare centres, an extra year of pre-kindergarten education and tentative steps towards replacing an inefficient stamp duty with land tax, should all have a productive benefit. They're all aimed at growing the economic pie. Less productive is the $7.2 billion in ""cost-of-living"" measures announced by the NSW Treasurer to help with everything from road tolls, school costs, and energy bills. Similarly, the Queensland budget wasn't all bad. A big boost in health funding should ease pressures on the system. The multi-pronged cost of living crisis has spared few Australians from increased financial stress. In response, cash-strapped households have been forced to find new ways to cut back. But an extra $6.8 billion to help Queenslanders with ""cost of living pressures"" is again pumping more money and stimulus into the economy — just as inflation climbs higher. The temptation for politicians to pump cost of living relief into voters' pockets is understandable. Whether it wins votes is debatable, as the recent federal election showed. Whether it further fuels inflation and drives us off Lowe's path, we're about to see. ""It's a fairly narrow path,"" Lowe said in his speech on Tuesday. ""It's highly unlikely that we'll get it exactly right. We'll make mistakes. I hope the mistakes are not too large and we can self-correct."" Nothing is preset.

4,"Sri Lanka's economy has 'completely collapsed', Prime Minister says",business,"  Sri Lankan economy 'completely collapsed', Prime Minister says Sri Lanka's Prime Minister says its debt-laden economy has ""collapsed"" after months of shortages of food, fuel and electricity. Ranil Wickremesinghe told parliament the South Asian country is ""facing a far more serious situation beyond the mere shortages of fuel, gas, electricity and food"". ""Our economy has completely collapsed,"" he said. Wickremesinghe is also the Finance Minister tasked with stabilising the economy. He said Sri Lanka is unable to purchase imported fuel, even for cash, due to heavy debts owed by its petroleum corporation. ""Currently, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation is $700 million in debt,"" he said. ""As a result, no country or organisation in the world is willing to provide fuel to us. ""They are even reluctant to provide fuel for cash."" An economic collapse is forcing people all over Sri Lanka to find unconventional ways to survive. Wickremesinghe said the government missed out on the chance to turn the situation around. ""We are now seeing signs of a possible fall to rock bottom,"" he said. Mr Wickremesinghe said on Wednesday that Sri Lanka would call China, India and Japan to a donor conference to drum up more foreign assistance and present an interim budget in August. The budget seeks to put public finances on a more sustainable path and increase funds to the poor, who have been hardest hit, Mr Wickremesinghe told parliament. ""The interim budget will set the path forward,"" he said. It comes amid ongoing negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is in Sri Lanka for talks on a bailout program. ""[The budget], together with an IMF program and debt sustainability, will lay the foundation for Sri Lanka to return to economic stability,"" Mr Wickremesinghe said. The country already announced it is suspending repayment of $7 billion in foreign debt due for repayment this year, pending the outcome of negotiations with the IMF. It must pay $5 billion on average annually until 2026. The foreign currency crisis has resulted in massive shortages that have forced people to stand in long lines to buy essentials, including fuel, food and medicine.

5,UK inflation has hit a 40-year high — and we're going to feel this in Australia,business,"  UK inflation has hit a 40-year high. Here's what that means for Australia Another major economy has just recorded a large increase in inflation — a key measure of the cost of living. The UK Consumer Prices Index (CPI) rose by 9.1 per cent in the 12 months to May 2022, up from 9 per cent in April. UK inflation is now sitting at a 40-year high. Over the year to May, the CPI rose 7.9 per cent. According to the Office for National Statistics, the items in the ""basket"", or collection of goods and services, that make up the CPI that contributed the most to the overall increase in the index were gas and electricity bills, as well as petrol. In early June, financial markets plummeted on news US inflation had also soared to a 40-year high. The hike raised concerns the US Federal Reserve — the equivalent of Australia's Reserve Bank — would need to raise interest rates sharply to cool demand in the economy and bring inflation under control. Those fears were realised on June 15 when the Federal Reserve increased its benchmark interest rate by the highest amount since 1994. Unlike in Australia, wages growth in the US is playing a part in the inflation picture. But the war in Ukraine and supply constraints generated by the pandemic are the biggest culprits. That is because it is costing businesses more to secure inventory and supplies and they are passing those costs on to customers. But Australia is also suffering from these inflation pressures. Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe indicated on Tuesday that while much of the lift in inflation was being fuelled by overseas factors like the war in Ukraine and the pandemic, it was increasingly being generated locally. One of the biggest increases in the cost of living domestically is stemming from the east coast energy crisis. Aging coal-fired power plants are breaking down, which is making it difficult for energy generators to reliably supply power. From being smart about shopping for everyday items to making lifestyle changes to save on power, our readers share ways you can cut costs. The power producers are scrambling to fix the problems with their power plants, but the parts required to repair them are not always readily available due to shortages. That has caused havoc in the spot market for wholesale electricity in recent weeks. The spot market is where energy generators and retailers meet to help determine the price households pay for power by assessing the demand and supply of power available for customers. The market operator, AEMO, stepped in last week and took control of the market. Since then the market has stabilised, leading the AEMO to gradually pull back and allow the companies to work out the prices they charge for themselves. The supply of power remains a big issue, however, and that will likely lead to further increases in power bills. Medium-term solutions, including the capacity mechanism the government is currently working through, could help secure a portion of power supplies but they might put further upwards pressure on energy prices. The AEMO Reserve Capacity Mechanism recently announced by the federal government will see gas retailers — the ones that appear on your energy bill — paying the power generators to keep gas in reserve for when there is another supply emergency. Analysts say the retailers will pass that cost on to customers, producing higher energy bills. ""And, as a consequence, that insurance is something that we as consumers will all pay for because we are going to get reliable power,"" Grattan Institute energy and climate change program director Tony Wood said. Treasurer Jim Chalmers warned Australian households the cost of living was set to get worse before it got better. Australia's inflation rate, or CPI, is currently 5.1 per cent. The next CPI will be released by the Bureau of Statistics on July 27 this year.

6,Family of driver killed while delivering food gets $830k in landmark decision,business,"  Family of food delivery driver Xiaojun Chen, who died at work, granted $830k compensation The widow and children of a food delivery driver who was hit by a bus and killed in Sydney will receive a $830,000 payout, after a landmark court decision found he was an employee. Xiaojun Chen, 43, died while riding his motorbike for Hungry Panda in the suburb of Zetland in September 2020, leaving behind his wife Lihong Wei, their two children and his 75-year-old father, who all live in China. The Transport Workers Union (TWU) said the Personal Injury Commission found Mr Chen was entitled to workers' compensation, after Hungry Panda admitted liability for his death. Ms Wei, who had to farewell her husband via video call from rural China to a Sydney hospital, said her husband worked in Australia to send money home to her family. ""My children miss their daddy every day,"" she said. ""My daughter has begun struggling with school and my son has lost his father forever at just eight years old. Nothing can ever fix this."" TWU national secretary Michael Kaine welcomed the decision and praised Ms Wei for pursuing compensation. ""After two long years, justice has finally been delivered for Xiaojun's family,"" he said. The TWU has been campaigning for food delivery riders to have rights such as minimum wages and workers' compensation benefits, regardless of the 'contractor' label imposed on their jobs. Jasmina Mackovic from the Slater and Gordon law firm said the decision was ""the first of its kind in a workers compensation sense"". ""Gig economy workers and their families are usually denied any entitlements because they are considered independent contractors rather than employees, meaning they are unable to access workers' compensation and other benefits such as annul leave and sick leave,"" she said. ""This is hopefully just the start of some changes which will support those who don't normally have a voice because they have to take on jobs of any kind and just try and support their families."" University of Sydney industrial relations expert, Chris F Wright, said it was a significant decision. ""It is a decision that goes against the grain of the past few decades of legal developments in Australia in the area of employment, which have very much gone against workers and in favour of employers,"" he said. ""I think the decision could have implications for other workers in the gig economy who are injured while doing their jobs and their capacity to get compensation for that, but it remains to be seen whether this decision will have implications for other jurisdictions or other areas of employment law."" The Federal Court has previously ruled that a Foodora Australia delivery driver was an employee when he was unfairly sacked. An industrial relations fight is looming as employers protest mooted changes giving more employment security to gig-economy workers. But in a similar case involving UberEats, the Federal Court found drivers and riders were contractors, because they could choose when and where they worked. NSW Employment Relations Minister Damien Tudehope said the “old model” of excluding some worker entitlements by putting them on contract may no longer be appropriate. ""I think that we do need to develop a policy in relation to the gig economy,"" he said. ""The successful outcome of that claim sends a signal that we do need to do a lot more work in respect of how we treat workers engaged in the gig economy."" A NSW upper house inquiry into technology on industry and workers is due to publish a report later this year.

7,"'Flawed' market dominated by 'gentailers' led to Enova's collapse, green energy provider says",business,"  Enova says 'flawed' market dominated by 'gentailers' led to green energy provider's collapse How can skyrocketing prices drive a ""green energy"" retailer out of a market grappling with a mix of renewable power sources? That is a question some of Enova's 13,000 customers might be asking after Australia's first community-owned energy retailer was placed into voluntary administration. The move was announced on Tuesday, less than two weeks after the company was named the winner of the Finder AU Green Energy Retailer of the Year award for 2022. The situation highlights an anomaly — even when smaller retailers do their best to buy energy from renewable sources, it all goes into the national grid. Former chair Alison Crook, who helped to found the Byron Bay-based company in 2016, said retailers had to buy supplies from a market that was ""spot priced"" every five minutes. ""Solar and wind [generators] are not allowed to bid, they just say how much they can put in,"" she said. ""But they're not allowed to bid because they're regarded as unstable sources, so they never get to set the price. ""As it happens, we've hit winter — the demand is higher, there's never been quite enough wind and solar to fill the grid. ""In fact, I think we're saying fossil fuels in NSW are still meeting 70-80 per cent of the fuel needs."" Ms Crook said the structure of the energy market allowed some companies to thrive when prices jumped from $70-80 per megawatt hour to $300-400. Here is what we know about the price cap, the strain on the energy grid and how you can keep your bill and energy consumption as low as possible. She said the system favoured ""gentailers"" like AGL, Origin and EnergyAustralia. ""Gentailers are organisations that own both generation and retail … so that they benefit when there is market volatility,"" Ms Crook said. ""They benefit when they can get high prices for wholesale. ""Even if a retailer is buying in a market at a higher price, they can make super profits on the generation end. ""They own both ends of the supply chain. ""So the point is that it's a flawed market structure — it should never have been allowed to be created and it needs to be broken up. ""If the government doesn't step in to protect small retailers, then there will not be any competition left."" Federal Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen was asked about the situation at a media conference on Wednesday. After a mere two weeks to assess the state of the National Electricity Market, Chris Bowen has found it crumbling in his hands, writes Melissa Clarke. ""I know that Enova energy entered a very difficult period over the last 24 hours, which is disappointing for them and for all their customers,"" he said. ""They're a good company, but we continue to monitor the situation very, very carefully and closely. ""Ultimately we need more transmission, more storage and more generation of electricity. ""I continue to remain in very close contact with the regulator and the ACCC about the state of the market."" Enova customers will be automatically transferred to a new retailer, but any bills issued by Enova before the transfer will need to be paid. A creditors' meeting will be held on June 30. With few assets to liquidate, it is not known how much value will be returned to shareholders or whether a buyer for the renewable retailer will be found.

8,Tried booking a removalist lately? You might be waiting a while,business,"  Why south-east Queensland removalists are in such high demand A shortage of labour is affecting almost every industry in Australia, but for removalists the problem is just one of many factors making everyday business more difficult. Grace Removals group ecommerce and marketing manager Andrew Wilson said COVID, the sheer number of people moving around the country — and more recently, the world — as well as fuel prices and an ageing workforce were all putting pressure on removalists, and there was still months before the peak summer season began. In particular, Queensland recorded the biggest population growth, with Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data to September 2021 showing it had a 1.1 per cent increase in residents. Victoria recorded the biggest exodus with a negative growth rate of -0.5 per cent. The ABS said net interstate migration was the major contributor to population change in Queensland and the Northern Territory. Overall, Australia's quarterly population growth was 12,100 people (0.05 per cent) with annual growth even smaller at 0.3 per cent. Mr Wilson said the figures backed up his observations. ""We did definitely see a big exodus out of Victoria and NSW to Queensland. That has slowed down now and it's a balanced trade in and out,"" he said. ""And the other thing was the well-spoken-about move to the regions and we are absolutely seeing regional centres pick up from the Central Coast of NSW, Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast and Hervey Bay. ""Northern NSW, the south coast of NSW, Bendigo, Wangaratta and Wodonga are doing really well too. ""Tassie again is a bit of a beneficiary, with a lot of movement there."" Western Australia's open borders are also attracting some migration, and workers on sponsored visas are trickling back into the country from overseas. Mr Wilson said there was a gradual return to Queensland of Australians who had been stuck overseas. James Morell operates Brisbane company Muval and said he too had noticed some movement back to states such as Victoria, but there were still plenty of people making tree-change and sea-change moves in Queensland. His Muval Index reports on how, when, where and why Australians are moving, and this year a team of statisticians from the University of Queensland is helping to quantify the information in an annual report due out in the coming weeks. For those wanting to book a removalist, Mr Morell advised booking early, particularly ahead of the peak season. ""Availability starts to run out particularly in November and early December across the entire industry,"" he said. ""So we encourage people who are moving at the end of the year to start booking as early as August."" Grace Removals has at least 100 vacant positions in its 30 branches around Australia, according to Mr Wilson. ""It's a problem that has been brewing for some time and the low unemployment rate is certainly exacerbating the issue,"" he said. Latest statistics show the number of people moving to regional areas doubled across the country during the pandemic. ""I've probably heard of it for 10 years, and it is getting harder and harder to attract people into the industry. ""It's quite hard work and we ask a lot in terms of skills — we always need drivers, people with heavy rigid and higher licences. ""We certainly do have a program in place that offers well-structured training from the ground up and we assist with forklift licences. ""It's been a challenge to recruit. People say it's an immigration issue, and that is partly true, but it depends on the region."" While removalists have not relied on backpackers, Mr Wilson said the exodus of overseas-born residents during COVID, particularly those from New Zealand, had caused some shortages. Optimove office manager Laila Ali said the weekly struggle to find staff would be helped once international travel into Australia normalised. She said international students, in particular, were a ""big help in terms of staffing"" and helped improve competition for jobs. Ms Ali noticed a ""huge amount"" of work continuing to come out of Melbourne and Sydney with residents moving to Queensland. ""We offer services to regional Queensland but it's not a big demand going out into the country,"" she said. ""It's more local moves in Brisbane because of the property market, or to the Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast."" With an expertise in marketing, Mr Wilson has increasingly been called on to use his skills to advertise the industry to potential employees, not potential customers. Loving life in regional Australia doesn't need to mean sacrificing your career ambitions. One of his tactics is to make moving to a remote area attractive by offering rental subsidies and offering all staff health insurance discounts and other perks. ""We're really having to think quite differently about our recruitment strategy and I don't think it'll get resolved anytime soon,"" Mr Wilson said. ""The answer is employers like us really working extra hard to both attract and retain staff. That includes trying to bring on as many benefits as we can and trying to create as positive an environment as possible. ""Wages are part of that and wages have been increasing. No-one is on the award and they shouldn't be. You wouldn't attract people if they were on the award."" Mr Wilson said it took about four months to train a ""valuable"" worker and up to five years before a removalist could be described as highly skilled. Mr Morell started Muval in 2016 and now employs about 50 staff, up from 10 people six years ago. But he agreed retaining good staff was a challenge. ""We're in a privileged position where we can offer quite a flexible operation, but it is really difficult to get the number of candidates to interview and fill seats,"" he said. ""It was easy for a second when businesses were laying people off and we took on quite a number of Flight Centre employees, then it got really hard, but now it's a bit easier again. ""After going through the last couple of years there were lots of people wanting to make a change, so it's about trying to retain people while attracting people trying to make that change.""

9,"Here's how electric cars will impact the power grid, and what's being done to avert the threat",business,"  Electric vehicles could significantly increase demand on the power grid, trials underway to change energy use behaviour Electric cars could increase demand on the power grid during the evening peak by at least 30 per cent unless households adopt smart charging, a new trial shows. Origin Energy has teamed up with the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) to understand ways to change the behaviour of electric car owners before their mass adoption in Australia. With the threat of blackouts a reality amid higher prices and demand, Origin's general manager of e-mobility Chau Le said the network would struggle once EVs became more popular. ""At the moment our electricity grid is not coping at all,"" she said. ""If we were to add another 30 per cent of peak load to the grid during those periods of high prices and constraints on the network, this would require significant investment to increase capacity."" To manage the looming threat, Origin and ARENA have been trialling ""smart charging"", with results published yesterday. Smart chargers, costing between $2,000 and $3,000, were installed in homes of 150 EV users and baseline data was captured. The chargers allow people to set their charging times, for example when there is more low-cost renewable energy being produced or to support the grid at times of peak demand. It found that without intervention, 30 per cent of charging was done in the evening peak, between 3pm and 9pm. However, Mrs Le said the participants were highly engaged and early adopters of technology and many regular motorists may not pay as much attention to optimal charging times. ""We do expect that with mass adoption of EVs and less engaged EV drivers, on energy, that peak consumption will be much higher than the 30 per cent,"" she said. Trial one saw participants given a 10-cent-per-kilowatt-hour credit on their electricity bill for charging off-peak. That reward reduced charging in the evening peak to 10 per cent, or a 67 per cent decrease from the baseline. Trial two saw Origin take the reins of charging times to limit it to mostly off-peak through a ""plug-in and forget"" method. They could even nimbly respond to ""critical peak events"", as seen early last week, to switch off any charging. This method reduced the evening peak usage to only 6 per cent, or an 80 per cent decrease from the baseline. Despite the incentives leading to significant behavioural change, EV drivers still charged in the evening peak between 6 and 10 per cent of the time. ""If that 6 per cent is all located in one network patch, then that will have a magnified impact on that local substation or the local connection,"" Mrs Le said. Mrs Le said the third part of the trial, which is ongoing, would see Origin work with power distributors (Citipower, Powercor and United Energy) to understand if the grid would need to be upgraded to meet the baseline usage seen in the trials, once mass adoption of EVs takes place. ARENA chief executive Darren Miller said they funded $840,000 of the $2.9 million of the trial, adding that three others with retailers and distributors were also running across the country. Mr Miller said ARENA, an independent federal government agency, was investing in the research because they were ""very concerned"" about what might happen when EVs became more popular. ""If we all end up having EVs and charging them at exactly the same time, say 6pm to 9pm on weeknights, then no doubt the distribution system won't be able to cope with that,"" he said. ""Extra investment will have to be made and that will cost all of us on our electricity bill too ultimately. ""I think if we do this really well, we could expect there to be not much extra costs involved from the distribution companies. ""We can make sure we don't have to invest an extraordinary amount in the distribution system, the poles and wires outside our homes and businesses, to accommodate that extra load."" EVs are forecast to become more popular from 2025, when the price of batteries is expected to fall to a point that the cars reach a price parity with traditional vehicles. Mrs Le pointed to research that showed that if EVs made up 80 per cent of new car sales by 2030, and all were plugged in the evening peak, the instantaneous load would double peak electricity demand. ""There could be pockets [of upgrades], but there could just be like, mass upgrade to the distribution network all together,"" Mrs Le said. The final paper of the trials is due in December, but Mrs Le said early results demonstrated that financial rewards worked to get drivers to charge off-peak. Despite the slow uptake, the industry is about to undergo a significant shift that could sway many consumers. She said they were yet to establish whether they would be needed long term or just for the short term, until habits were formed. ""We see it as sharing the value back to the customers,"" Mrs Le said. ""The value we see two buckets; wholesale price arbitrage — if we can push consumption outside of that very high price period, it saves the retailer money and then we can share that back. ""The other value bucket is if the network can save money, that they would have otherwise need to spend to upgrade the network, the network can share that back to the customer as well."" We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Mr Miller said despite the current energy system woes and the rise of EVs, there was no need for ""panic"". ""Electricity is already a way cheaper than petrol and diesel so I'm very confident that we're going to get a cost advantage anyway, as we shift to electric vehicles,"" he said. ""The question is just how much of a cost advantage, I think we can do even better if we have a technology solution like smart charging and that's what we're working on.""

10,BlueScope plans new life for excess 200ha of steelworks land,business,"  BlueScope announces Port Kembla land sale, dispersal plans BlueScope is figuring out what it can do with 200 hectares of land it no longer needs adjacent to its Port Kembla steelworks, south of Wollongong. The company has announced an 18-month program to transform land located mainly to the south and west of the steelworks site. BlueScope managing director Mark Vassella said it was timed to coincide with work to re-line the company's Number Six blast furnace and transition to low emission steelmaking. ""So we will now as I say consult broadly, think about what the opportunities are but really it's about activating that excess land,"" he said. ""[It's about] expanding how we think about it and then really shaping what the future social and economic sustainability of the region could be."" Mr Vassella said opportunities existed to repurpose old industrial buildings as well as potentially hand back sections of land to the community. ""Really we have the opportunity as a company and as a community to be involved in any stage of that development process,"" he said. He said that ranged from having excess parcels of land they choose to sell, to being a developer, to gifting and granting back to the community access to particular parts of the facility. Mr Vassella said the company had employed an architect and urban design firm to develop a master plan involving community consultation with First Nations people, residential and industrial neighbours, employees, the council and the NSW Government. BlueScope says its Port Kembla facility will produce the first NSW-built wind turbines after securing a $55.4 million federal grant to upgrade its steelmaking capability. Port Kembla-based Wollongong councillor Ann Martin welcomed the announcement. Ms Martin, who is also an artist, said she saw opportunities for creative industries such as film making and arts festivals. ""My heart is thumping at a thousand miles a second,"" she said. ""It's very, very exciting."" She said she had recently been to Austria where she visited the Arts, Science and Technology Festival. ""We were given a tour through a repurposed tobacco factory,"" she said. ""In that factory was artists, designers, architects, boutique manufacturers. ""While we were there they were just preparing their tender for a hotel on the site."" Bluescope says an update on master planning work will be provided in due course.

11,Chinese investment in Australia plunged to 'literally none'. Has China already bought what it wanted?,business,"  Chinese investors fast abandoning Australia but still hold vast amounts of infrastructure, land and water Chinese investors are fast abandoning Australia as a frosty bilateral relationship dampens trade, with a report showing Chinese investment in Australia nosedived by almost 70 per cent last year to the lowest level since 2007. A report by KPMG and The University of Sydney found Chinese firms laid out $778 million in Australia in 2021, compared to $2.5 billion in 2020. At its peak in 2008, when Beijing desperately needed natural resources to boost the economy, investors from China splurged about $US16.2 billion  ($19.1bn based on 2008 exchange rate) in Australia, which was 24 times more than last year. The number of deals last year almost halved to 11, from 20 in 2020. Four transactions — related to acquiring iron ore and lithium mines — accounted for most of the total Chinese investment inflows last year. Since 2017, Chinese investment in Australia has been plummeting, but last year's results have shocked experts who have been monitoring the trend. ""The decline really has now gone to a level where there is literally none or very little investment coming from China,"" Hans Hendrischke, report co-author and professor in Chinese business and management from the University of Sydney, told ABC News. ""We are surprised in a sense that it's dropping so fast."" While there has been a diplomatic breakthrough and a significant shift in tone towards China from the new government, experts say it might take some time for Chinese investors to return. In recent years, Chinese investors have been facing the double whammy of a domestic clampdown on capital export and stricter screening from Australian regulators. In 2016, Beijing started to impose restrictions on capital outflows due to concerns over excessive debt, inappropriate investment and capital flight. At the same time, Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board's (FIRB) tougher application process subdued interest from potential Chinese buyers. Professor Hendrischke said the current geopolitical climate was another obstacle. ""US, very strongly, and Europe, [including] the UK, Germany and France, are screening Chinese investment now for any potential conflicts that they could have with Chinese controls over certain assets [and] Australia is part of that,"" he said. ""The relationship between Australia and China is not a very good one at the moment and diplomatic contacts are interrupted. That does not allow us to go ahead or even approve more investment."" An example is Chinese-owned tech giant Huawei. The Turnbull government banned it from taking part in the rollout of 5G mobile infrastructure due to national security concerns. Despite the highly politicised atmosphere, Wei Li, a lecturer in international business at the University of Sydney, said Chinese investors were holding on to their Australian assets. ""I don't see a major trend of Chinese companies withdrawing their investment in Australia yet,"" Dr Li said. ""The main sentiment is to wait and see. For a lot of Chinese companies, Australia is their first overseas country that they have ever invested [in]. There's a lot of commitment."" Traditionally, Chinese firms view Australia as a ""test market"". They get a ""Western experience"" by investing in Australia and then expand to other similar economies. Analysts argue the huge loss of foreign funding from China means Australian companies may miss out on future opportunities, including access to the Chinese domestic market. Between 2007 and 2021, China's state-owned enterprises and private companies poured a total of $158 billion into Australia, including by investing or acquiring mining and energy companies, infrastructure, wind turbine farms and a dairy processor. Last year, Suzhou CATH Energy-Technologies invested $318 million in lithium explorer AVZ Minerals and Clive Palmer's Balmoral Iron was bought by CITIC for $187 million, according to the report. In 2017, Chinese mining group Yancoal acquired Rio Tinto coal assets Coal & Allied, including the Hunter Valley's Mount Thorley and Warkworth sites. Two of Australia's biggest energy companies were acquired by Chinese firms in the past decade. Energy Australia was sold to China Light and Power Company by the NSW government in 2011, while the sale of Alinta Energy to Chinese company Chow Tai Fook was approved by then-treasurer Scott Morrison in 2017. In terms of infrastructure, Chinese company Landbridge Group secured a 99-year lease of Darwin Port for over $500 million in 2015, and a Chinese-backed consortium successfully bid $1.75 billion for a 98-year lease of the world's biggest coal port, the Port of Newcastle, in 2014. The controversial lease Darwin Port remains in the spotlight amid China’s new security pact with Solomon Islands. So, how and why did it happen? However, both deals drew criticism from politicians and national security experts. According to 2021 government reports on foreign ownership of agricultural land and water, Chinese companies were also big stakeholders in those areas. Currently, 14.1 per cent of Australia's agricultural land is foreign owned, and China is the largest foreign owner (2.3 per cent). China is also the third-largest stakeholder of Australian water behind Canada and the US, owning 604 gigalitres or 1.5 per cent of the total Australian water entitlement. About 11 per cent of the Australian water is foreign owned. Under the ""going out"" strategy, initiated by the Chinese government at the turn of this century, Chinese firms were encouraged to invest aboard. The aim was to secure natural resources and intellectual property to support the growth of the economy. ""Over the last decade or so, China has really become one of the world's largest foreign investors,"" according to Gerard Burg, senior economist at National Australia Bank. ""This was a conscious decision. Initially, it was very heavily resource intensive. A lot of investment in countries like Australia was seeking access to things like iron ore and coal. ""But more recently, it has moved away from those sort of investment targets, more towards things like technology."" Professor Hendrischke agreed, saying that after the mining boom, when state-led Chinese firms acquired enough assets, they shifted towards health care, agribusiness and renewable energy. But more recently, as the geopolitical competition between China and the US flared, investment interest in Australia shifted from bigger acquisitions to safe assets. About one-third of total investment over the past two years was held in commercial real estate. ""There is a degree of insecurity and uncertainty,"" Professor Hendrischke said. ""How the relationship between the US and China plays out over the long term will have an impact on Australia."" The report also found Chinese companies were flocking to Europe and countries associated with the Belt and Road Initiative. Last year, Chinese investment in Europe grew by one-quarter. ""Just as we've been debating how to diversify away from China here in Australia, China has already started diversifying away from Australia in this regard,"" Pichamon Yeophantong, a senior lecturer at UNSW Canberra, said. Despite the pandemic, China has continued to invest abroad at a steady pace. According to China's Ministry of Commerce, outbound direct investment from China rose by 9.2 per cent to $208 billion. In 2020, while investment globally was falling, China's government claimed to be the world's largest investor, with total spending of $220.5 billion. Economists have noticed big discrepancies between official and unofficial measures, such as the American Enterprise Institute’s China Global Investment Tracker. ""There is some uncertainty around the accuracy of this data,"" Mr Burg said. ""The key destinations for China's private investment, according to that official data, have been Hong Kong, as well as two notable tax havens, the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands. ""One possibility is that the investors are trying to mask the origin of investment funds. By going through the tax havens, they can wash away the concerns in other countries about Chinese investment. ""Or it's the possibility that Chinese firms and high-net-worth individuals maybe try to get their capital out of China. That would be a major negative for China's long-term growth prospects, particularly concerns around its financial sector."" President Xi Jinping's ""common prosperity"" policies have sparked fears of wealth redistribution in recent years, especially in the tech and financial sectors. Mr Burg noted that Australian data showed the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands were the sources of the ninth-largest and 20th-largest stock of foreign direct investment in 2020, while Hong Kong ranked 11th overall. China's official data also shows Chinese investment in countries affiliated with the Belt and Road Initiative increased by 14 per cent to $28.6 billion last year. The initiative aims to connect more than 65 countries across various continents for trade, with a particular focus on infrastructure-starved developing nations. It has also been widely viewed as a tool for Beijing to exercise soft power. But the lack of transparency in Chinese loans terms and the alarming debt levels among poor nations have sparked speculation about ""debt-trap diplomacy"". The theory is when a country defaults or keeps borrowing more to repay its loans, Beijing will have some leverage in demanding concessions or other advantages in exchange for debt relief. ""China's share of outstanding external debt to emerging market countries has increased sharply over the past decade,"" Carmen Altenkirch, from asset management company Aviva Investors, said. ""This reflected a desire on the part of some emerging market governments to access capital for infrastructure investment, and a willingness on the part of Chinese entities to lend. ""China is one of the largest creditors to emerging market countries at a time when debt is, or is quickly becoming, unsustainable for many."" The trade war between Beijing and Canberra is hurting both sides greatly, but will the change of Australian government bring it to an end? However, Ms Altenkirch said there was no evidence Chinese authorities had actively tried to put certain countries into too much debt. China's former central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, rejected suggestions his country was using debt-trap diplomacy, saying debtor countries demanded Chinese lending and it provided long-term economic benefits. ""There is a certain degree of difficulty in this process, and it must be carefully considered and designed to find a way to alleviate the debt problems of the countries along the Belt and Road, while avoiding suggestions that there are bad motives,"" he said at an economic forum in April.

Under current rules, victims of crime who seek compensation cannot access funds held in the offender's superannuation account Grace Tame says ""paedophiles should be responsible for compensating their victims"" Under the current rules, victims of crime who launch civil action for compensation against their perpetrators cannot access any funds held in the offender's superannuation accounts. ""Paedophiles are able to hide their assets in their super, which should be available to compensate survivors of abuse,"" she said. ""What this means is that the liability is on the taxpayer to fund the compensation of survivors. ""What needs to change is that paedophiles should be responsible for compensating their victims."" Victims' advocate Howard Brown said the issue came to light in 2017, when the victims of convicted Bega Valley paedophile Maurice Van Ryn discovered they would be unable to access hundreds of thousands of dollars he had in superannuation through a civil compensation claim. ""We found that [Van Ryn] was virtually [penniless] as he had placed all his funds into his superannuation account,"" Mr Brown said. ""And [Van Ryn] basically said to us: 'Everything I have is in my superannuation account, and you can't touch that.' ""And of course, he was correct – we couldn't."" In 2018 then-financial services minister Kelly O'Dwyer promised legislative changes to give victims access to their perpetrators' superannuation for compensation, but the plan stalled. Adelaide-based lawyer Andrew Carpenter has been pushing for the reform to be introduced since 2020. ""It's going to save the taxpayer, it's going to punish offenders, and it's going to finally be something that compensates survivors,"" Mr Carpenter said. Mr Carpenter has joined with the Grace Tame Foundation, established by the 2021 Australian of the Year, as well as Fighters Against Child Abuse Australia and the Carly Ryan Foundation to lobby the new Labor government to introduce superannuation reform. Labor was asked for comment on this reform while in opposition, but has not made any commitments. Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said in a statement: ""I have not yet had the opportunity to discuss Ms Tame's proposal with her."" ""The government would welcome a discussion on how we can support survivors and the role that each level of government should play,"" he said. The Grace Tame Foundation, Fighters Against Childhood Abuse Australia, and the Carly Ryan Foundation have written to the Assistant Treasurer to request a meeting. Ms Tame said the legal loophole was another example of a system stacked against victim-survivors of sexual abuse. ""It's really important for people to understand the fundamental power imbalance between survivors and paedophiles,"" she said. ""Where we seem to keep going wrong is in simplifying it to one between individuals – it isn't. ""And [this is] a classic example of systems abuse that remains unchanged. ""Instead of thinking of it in terms of individual perpetrators and individual victims, it is [actually] individual victims versus an entire machine."" Mr Carpenter said it was not uncommon for convicted perpetrators to dispose of their assets before going to prison. He said this happened in the case of Adelaide woman Melissa Snelling, whose adoptive father Robert Snelling was jailed in 2019 for sexually abusing her as a child. ""Out of 10 years of doing survivor-victim claims, the case of Melissa Snelling was probably the hardest one I've been involved in,"" he said. ""That was the most heinous and abhorrent case of child exploitation that I've ever seen."" Mr Carpenter said before Snelling was jailed he attempted to sell his house to his son for $22,000 but was ordered to transfer the house to Melissa as part of the court ruling. ""That [house] was easy to claw back,"" he said. ""But when people have superannuation, that's something that's almost impossible to claw back. ""And that's something that this change will effectively do."" Ms Snelling said the persistent sexual abuse she suffered as a child had left her with ongoing mental and physical pain that no amount of financial compensation would fix. ""My life is seeing doctors, seeing psychologists, seeing counsellors, having support workers,"" she said. ""The judge presided over a certain amount and the derelict family home was sold and I was then put in a position to receive some of that money. But it cost me over $100,000 in legal fees. ""How do I keep maintaining financial security, when I've struggled all my life and I haven't had a career and I've got no superannuation to fall back on?"" Ms Snelling said the current system seemed unfair. ""It is seriously wrong,"" she said. ""It means they can come out of jail and set themselves back up again. ""Why do they deserve the right to be set back up again when they've given someone a sentence for life?"" Mr Brown said he hoped Anthony Albanese's federal government would consider the reform. ""I would be calling on the government to at least go back through Treasury, look at the discussion paper and the responses that they received to that discussion paper, and then make a decision themselves as to whether they can move forward from the results of that inquiry, or whether they need to call a new inquiry,"" he said. ""But what I would be saying is that time is of the essence, because unfortunately we don't get to save every victim. ""And if we can get a system in place where we can at least have financial assistance to victims so that they can receive proper treatment, then we are going to lose less victims."" Mr Brown acknowledged that one of the concerns raised in the past was that offenders would leave prison with no savings. ""One of the issues which I understand was a stumbling point for the previous Morrison government was that there was some concern that if we were to deplete a person's superannuation, they would then become dependent upon the government so that then the government would be seen as paying perpetrators a pension,"" he said. ""I didn't believe that that was a substantive issue, to be honest, because we would not be looking to deplete a person's superannuation. ""But we would be looking for reasonable compensation.""

13,Is it the beginning of the end for stamp duty?,business,"  The NSW government's land tax announcement explained — is this the beginning of the end of stamp duty? From next year, some first home buyers in NSW will be able to choose between paying the lump sum of stamp duty or an annual land tax. While first homeowners will be the only immediate beneficiaries, NSW Treasurer Matt Kean was not shy about voicing ambition to extend it. ""This is the first step in making sure that we start testing the waters for tax reform in New South Wales,"" said Mr Kean. Under the plan first home buyers purchasing a property up to $1,500,000 can opt to pay an annual fee of $400 plus 0.3 per cent of the land value. There's plenty of health spending and some big reforms for first home buyers — this is how NSW Treasurer Matt Kean's first budget will affect you. For example, buying a $1.35m house, with a land value of $810,000, the stamp duty would be $59,125. But if a buyer is holding on to the property for less than 20 years, they are better off paying the $2,830-per-year land tax — which would total $56,600. For apartments, the deal is better because land value is less. An $830,000 apartment, with a $265,000 land value, would require an up-front payment of $32,440 stamp duty, or the buyer could pay $1,195-per-year land tax. For Ryan Dalusag, who is both a real estate agent and a prospective first home buyer, the plan to replace stamp duty with land tax has merit. ""Being spread out over a longer period of time it helps me personally, not having to put up as big deposit,"" Mr Dalusag said. ""After hearing the announcement today, I find that it's a little more doable, achievable to secure a property."" ""For most first-time buyers, the biggest challenge is getting that initial deposit together,"" Ray White chief economist Nerida Conisbee said. ""If a first-time buyer doesn't need to pay $20,000-$30,000 in stamp duty to buy their first home, it allows them to get in a bit earlier and certainly with a much smaller deposit."" But it will cost the NSW government a lot of money to make changes to stamp duty, which is a key stream of revenue. ""It's a big revenue earner, it accounts for around a quarter of total revenue for the state government,"" Ms Conisbee said. ""Moving to a land tax system will take a lot of work, for people to get used to paying an annual land tax and for the government coffers to get used to less revenue."" From being smart about shopping for everyday items to making lifestyle changes to save on power, our readers share ways you can cut costs. Despite stamp duty being a good revenue raiser, it is not good for much else, according to Property Council NSW executive director Luke Achterstraat. ""Stamp duty is volatile, it's inefficient, it actually traps people in their homes,"" he said. ""People feel they've made a really significant cost to purchase a property, so stay in their homes for longer than really is appropriate. Mr Achterstraat says stamp duty is a ""triple threat"" that is bad for home ownership, household mobility and jobs. ""What the government's done today is put a bit of a stake in the ground and say we're going to trial this change."" The land tax option will save some first home buyers money, particularly those who do not want to stay in the same house for a long time. However, NSW Labor say there are better ways of supporting home buyers, including extending the stamp duty concessions. The NSW government has extended the stamp duty exemption for properties under $650,000 and reduction for homes before $800,000. ""If you're going to put money on the table for first home buyers, why introduce a brand new land tax system for New South Wales when we've never had one before, rather than just extending the exemptions to allow people to pay no land tax at all,"" Opposition Leader Chris Minns said. Social services and community housing advocates are also disappointed that there was not more in the budget for vulnerable people. ""There are more than 50,000 households on the social housing waiting list in New South Wales,"" Caitlin McDowell, from the Community Housing Industry Association said. ""Some of these people wait 10 or more years to be housed. ""The New South Wales government has committed to build just 320 new social homes over the next 12 months, that is an absolute outrage.""

14,Smash 'em and eat 'em: Growers desperately need you to eat more avocados,business," ABC Rural Avocado oversupply prompts calls for Australians to stock up while they're cheap Struggling avocado growers are appealing to customers to smash their way through a glut of cheap fruit before it sends many in the industry to the wall. Avocado supply is outstripping demand across the country leaving many growers struggling to make a profit. Avocados Australia chief executive John Tyas said the industry was desperate to lift the domestic and international intake of the fruit. ""Australians are some of the highest consumers of avocados in the world already but we need to ramp that up further,"" he said. ""[Australians] were eating around 4 kilograms of avocados per person in 2021, but we need to be getting up to around 5 to 6kg."" Mr Tyas said almost 80 per cent of Australian households ate avocados but there was still room to grow. The oversupply situation is set to worsen due to hundreds of new avocado trees that were planted within the past decade coming into production, adding to the surplus of fruit. Farmer Nola Stumm said she was worried about the future of her 160-hectare avocado farm at Comboyne on New South Wales' Mid North Coast. ""We've got a lot of young plantings that are coming into the market [but] we've already got plenty of fruit about,"" she said. ""So we need people to be eating lots of Australian avocados. ""We also want to grow our exports but currently only Western Australia is having success accessing new markets."" Mr Tyas said WA's crop was down from last year, which was good news for east coast growers. ""As we come into spring and summer we'll see supply volumes taper off,"" he said. ""I suppose there's a bit of a reprieve for east coast growers coming later this year. ""But longer term, you will most likely see massive volumes once again around the country and that trend is going to continue for the next few years to come."" From steak to tacos, here are 11 recipes to make the most of the avocado glut. Avocados Australia is also working to access and develop new export markets. WA growers recently gained access to the Japanese market and are set to send their first consignment as early as this week. Mr Tyas said east coast growers were not yet included in the trade deal due to the presence of Queensland fruit fly. ""In WA, they have a species called the Mediterranean fruit fly and lots of countries around the world have that species, so there's been lots of research over many, many years on market access protocols,"" he said. ""On the east coast, we have Queensland fruit fly, which is only found in Australia."" From being smart about shopping for everyday items to making lifestyle changes to save on power, our readers share ways you can cut costs. Mr Tyas said there had been a lot more research in recent years involving the Queensland fruit fly, which he was confident would underpin protocols enabling access to regions that already had the pest. ""Now that we've got that, we want to push on and really get the Australian government to negotiate these protocols for us,"" he said. ""Because once the east coast has got access, we'll be able to supply that market year-round."" The organisation is also looking to export to India and Thailand, as well as expand its already established trade with Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong. Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries extension horticulturist Simon Newett said growers needed to focus on fruit quality, which had been negatively impacted by prolonged wet weather, for Australian avocados to become a strong player in the global market. ""If you export bad quality food, we're going to get a very bad name overseas,"" Mr Newett said. ""We're going to shoot ourselves in the foot. ""And this season, the way it's been with all the rain and overcast conditions, [it] has made it even more challenging to get that good quality product.""

15,Prime Minister to visit Paris to 'reset' Australia's relationship with France,business,"  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to visit Paris to 'reset' Australia's relationship with France Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has confirmed he will visit French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris next week to formally ""reset"" diplomatic relations, which were flung into the freezer after the Morrison government scrapped a massive deal to build 12 submarines. In an interview on the ABC's 7.30, Mr Albanese said he was invited to France by Mr Macron and expected to receive a warm welcome. ""We do need to reset. We've already had very constructive discussions,"" the Prime Minister added. Earlier this month, the new Labor government announced it had agreed to pay French shipbuilder Naval Group $835 million in compensation for the scraped deal. In total, $3.4 billion was spent on the program, a figure Mr Albanese labelled an ""extraordinary waste"" of taxpayer money. ""France, of course, is central to power in Europe, but it's also a key power in the Pacific, in our own region as well,"" Mr Albanese told Leigh Sales. ""It's just one of the reasons why this needs to be a relationship that's nurtured, not damaged. ""What we can offer is a relationship between our respective leaders that won't be leaked in order to make an opportunistic headline in the newspaper, one of respect and honesty in the way that we deal with each other."" The submarine deal with France came at a time when Mr Macron was talking up the country's future as an ""Indo-Pacific power"" fully committed to the region. On a visit to Sydney in 2018, the President said the submarines were just the ""very beginning"" of a closer relationship with Australia that would be developed for ""the coming 50 years"". France is considered a key partner in efforts to limit China's expanding power and influence in the Pacific. Mr Albanese will be in Europe next week for a larger-than-normal NATO summit, where the Russian invasion of Ukraine will be the main item on the agenda. The Ukrainian ambassador in Canberra, Vasyl Myroshnychenko, is hopeful the Prime Minister might use the trip to offer more military assistance to his war-torn country. ""We need more heavy weaponry,"" Mr Myroshnychenko said, adding he hoped Australia would send more Bushmasters, a Bendigo-built troop carrier. ""We've got 40 Bushmasters … it would be great to get another 20,"" he said. ""I think it's coming that we'll get a young [Ukrainian] boy called Bushmaster. ""I think it's coming because Bushmaster is probably the most recognisable brand name of Australia in Ukraine right now, because if you mention Australia the next thing you hear is 'Bushmasters'."" Mr Albanese has also been invited to visit Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv. However, as is usually the case for trips near conflict zones, he declined to confirm whether he was taking up the offer. ""We're getting national security advice on that,"" Mr Albanese said. ""We don't want to cause a circumstance whereby there's risk to Australian personnel by undertaking such a visit. ""We'll take that advice and we'll act accordingly."" Even though much of the discussion at NATO is going to be about Russia's invasion, some defence and intelligence experts are urging the Prime Minister to use his trip to remind allies of China's growing aims for our region. ""They're trying to push us around and coerce us in our region of immediate strategic concern,"" Paul Dibb, a highly regarded analyst, said. Mr Dibb had an extensive career in Australian intelligence and defence, and was the primary author of the 1987 Defence White Paper. ""Our Prime Minister, our Foreign Minister and our Defence Minister need to keep at the centre of their minds, deeply etched in, their first priority is the defence of this country and making sure that our immediate region is not dominated by an aggressive expansionist power,"" he said. ""That has to be their first priority and it must not be eroded by being excited, if I may so, about Europe and NATO."" Faced with a number of international and domestic challenges, the new government has also inherited a budget that is on track to be more than a trillion dollars in debt in a few years' time. With inflation and interest rates rising, the Prime Minister has said some things he would like to do in the government's first budget in October will have to wait. ""We're going to have to really put the brakes on some of the spending which is there,"" Mr Albanese said. ""I've made it very clear there are a range of things we would like to do that we won't be able to do in our first budget. ""We will also be going through, line by line, looking for the waste."" A number of economists predict the government will have to start a difficult conversation about how the nation pays for the services Australians have come to expect. ""I expect the October budget will be simply about delivering on the promises they took to the election,"" Danielle Wood from the Grattan Institute said. ""I think by the time we get to next May, those fiscal challenges are going to be really starting to bite."" Labor's election commitment was to not raise taxes or have new ones — except on multinationals — though, in the longer term, broader reform may be required. ""I think tax has to be on the agenda,"" Ms Wood said. ""That may just be making the case for changes that the government might take to the next election.""

17,Samsung fined $14 million over misleading underwater ad campaigns,business,"  Samsung fined $14 million for misleading consumers about water resistance of Galaxy smartphones Samsung Australia has been fined $14 million for misleading customers into thinking their phones could safely be submerged in pool or sea water. The company made misleading claims about Galaxy phones in an ad campaign that ran from March 2016 to October 2018. Among the ads, one said: ""There's an underwater selfie in your future,"" along with the caveat the phones were water-resistant to 1.5 metres for up to 30 minutes. Another ad said: ""A phone can't swim the 100 metres,"" followed by the hashtag ""#Dowhatyoucant"". It was accompanied by footage of a phone getting splashed with water. Samsung Electronics Australia is being taken to the Federal Court for allegedly misleading consumers about the water resistance of its Galaxy mobile phones. The competition and consumer watchdog took Samsung Australia to the Federal Court over the claims. The phone company acknowledged that if Galaxy phones were submerged in pool or sea water, it was a material prospect their charging ports would become corroded and ultimately stop working if charged while wet. ""We reviewed hundreds of complaints from consumers who reported they experienced issues with their Galaxy phones after it was exposed to water and, in many cases, they reported their Galaxy phone stopped working entirely,"" Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said. She said Samsung's water-resistance claims were an important selling point for Galaxy phones and many people who bought them might have seen the ads beforehand. Before the phones' launch, Samsung Australia's parent company was already looking at the issue of port corrosion when people charged their phones after they got wet, the consumer watchdog said. Despite this, it went ahead with the campaign anyway. ""Samsung Australia's ads promoting its Galaxy phones featured people using their phones in pools and sea water, despite the fact that this could ultimately result in significant damage to the phone,"" Ms Cass-Gottlieb said. ""This penalty is a strong reminder to businesses that all product claims must be substantiated."" The Federal Court ordered Samsung Australia to pay $14 million in penalties after the company admitted to misleading consumers, the watchdog said. Samsung made the claims about the S7, S7 Edge, A5 , A7, S8, S8 Plus, and Note 8 Samsung Galaxy phones, of which there were more than 3.1 million sold in Australia. The watchdog urged anyone who bought a Galaxy phone and experienced the charging port issue to contact Samsung Australia. AAP has contacted Samsung Australia for comment.

18,Millennials say Australian dream 'actually a reality' as migration from capitals hits five-year high,business,"  Millennials drive regional growth as migration from capital cities hits five-year high Regional growth across Australia is being driven by a mass exodus from capital cities, with people aged 24-40 leading the tree change, new data shows. The Regional Movers Index report, a collaboration between the Regional Australia Institute (RAI) and the Commonwealth Bank, tracks movements between regional areas and capital cities Australia wide. Migration from capital cities to regional Australia increased by 16.6 per cent in the past 12 months, the highest level yet. In the past quarter the number of people moving from capitals was nine per cent higher than the post-pandemic average and 26.7 per cent higher than the average during the two years prior to the pandemic. In the 12 months to March this year, 61 per cent of total net outflows were from Sydney, while 45 per cent flowed from Melbourne. Daniel Fletcher was born and bred in Melbourne, but a job and a cheaper, larger house in Dalby. two hours west of Brisbane, were too good to pass up for his young family. ""The alternative is to be cooped up in a two-bedroom city apartment somewhere,"" he said. ""We colloquially use the term 'the Australian dream' of getting a backyard where the kids can grow up in, and that's actually a reality — it exists here."" But it was not just affordability that drew Mr Fletcher to regional life. ""Out here, it takes a village to raise kids and be a part of a family and it's a much easier, I think, to be in a welcoming community than it is to try and navigate your way through the rat race in a in a big city."" Western Downs Mayor Paul McVeigh said it was no surprise people were arriving in the region. ""We are attracting that next generation and they've got great career opportunities and they're getting jobs that would have taken years in much bigger regions,"" he said. Courtney Johnson moved to Dubbo in Western New South Wales from Hornsby, Sydney, with her partner Chris Bateman in October last year. ""We were travelling to work an hour and back every day, so most of our life was taken up by work and travel,"" Ms Johnson said. Her new employer was so desperate for staff they waited three months for her to arrive, and Mr Bateman arranged to work from home. For now they have no plans to move back to the city. ""We are already thinking about school for our three-year-old,"" Ms Johnson said. ""Our friends didn't really get why we made the move, but since they have visited they understand."" The couple bought a house, feeling it was the better option than renting. ""We put offers on 10 or 12 houses and kept getting beat out, so we ended up buying something we didn't really want. ""But it's cheaper than rent and we can use it for an investment property later."" South Australian real estate agent Daniel Eramiha said young people had been able to break into the housing market in smaller communities. ""We've got a lot of young people in Ceduna … who are now finally getting into the market with finance options available to them in the last six to 18 months,"" he said. ""I've seen a lot more local young people making the commitment to their town."" Mr Eramiha said there seemed to be a mix of newcomers and lifelong locals in the area Port Augusta realtor Michael Rowbottom said a growing number of people were looking to buy investment properties as a way into the market. ""Cheaper or mid-section properties costing below $150,000 are being snapped up fairly quickly,"" he said. Regional Australia Institute chief economist Kim Houghton said the movement of young people was beneficial for families and local economies. ""These are the people that build the desperately needed skills that a lot of these towns and regional centres need,"" he said. Commonwealth Bank regional and agribusiness banking executive general manager Paul Fowler said with nearly 85,000 job vacancies regional Australia was becoming even more attractive.

19,Electrician convicted of diverting power for cannabis crop has registration cancellation overturned,business,"  Adelaide electrician convicted of diverting power for cannabis crop has registration cancellation overturned An electrician who illegally diverted electricity from the grid to grow cannabis at his southern Adelaide home will keep his operating licence, after a tribunal overturned a decision to cancel it. Ryan Curran, 35, of Seaford, pleaded guilty in 2017 to cultivating a commercial quantity of cannabis and diversion of electricity without authority. He was fined and served a sentence of two years and one month on home detention. In May 2020, he applied for a building contractor's licence, which required a police check. After seeing Curran's criminal history, the commissioner for consumer affairs cancelled his electrician's registration and contractor's licence in August 2021. The commissioner found Curran was not a fit and proper person to hold one, in part because he had failed to flag his offending when he renewed his registration. Curran sought to overturn the commissioner's decision in the South Australian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (SACAT), arguing the failure was not deliberate. SACAT member Alex Reilly agreed in a decision published on Wednesday, accepting Curran's evidence that his partner was responsible for his online registration renewal, and she had ticked the box confirming he had not been charged with criminal offences. ""In considering whether the offence of diverting electricity carries any particular significance in the assessment of fitness and propriety, it is important to recognise that the whole cultivation operation was illegal, and completely out of the context of the applicant's business as an electrician,"" he said. ""As counsel for the applicant submitted, diversion of electricity is an essential part of the crime of cultivating cannabis, and it is very common for the offences of cultivation and diversion of electricity to be prosecuted together, and not just when the accused person is an electrician."" Professor Reilly said Curran had a good record as an electrician up until the cancellation of his licence, and two complaints registered against him had been resolved without further action. He disagreed with the commissioner for consumer affairs' submission that it was ""highly concerning"" that Curran was willing to permit unsafe electrical work in his own home. ""In my view, the fact that the breach of the Wiring Rules was only in the applicant's own home is a mitigating factor on the seriousness of this offending in relation to its impact on his licencing,"" he wrote. ""It would seem far worse for Mr Curran to place others at risk outside his home."" The tribunal set aside the commissioner's decision to cancel Curran's electrical contractor's licence and his electrical worker's registration. It ruled there should be no conditions placed on the registration or licence, in recognition of the fact there had been no official complaints about Curran's work, and he had been without his licence for five and  a half months.

20,Mining company to spend $2 million on land rehabilitation after investigations into alleged 'unauthorised disturbances',business,"  New Acland Coal Mine company to rehabilitate land after alleged 'unauthorised disturbances' A Brisbane-based mining company has agreed to spend more than $2 million to rehabilitate land in southern Queensland after an investigation into alleged illegal mining. New Hope Group had been under investigation since 2020 over ""alleged unauthorised disturbances"" in an area known as West Pit at its New Acland mine near Oakey. A Qld Department of Environment and Science (DES) spokesperson said the company had applied for the rehabilitation agreement as an alternative to enforcement action. ""The agreement means the habitat will be suitable for koalas and other fauna at its New Acland Coal Mine, 35 kilometres north-west of Toowoomba,"" the spokesperson said. The mine's general manager Dave O'Dwyer said the agreement was an alternative to taking the matter to the courts. He said its West Pit mining operation had been included in its plans. ""However, the DES disputed this as an accepted form of authorisation,"" Mr O'Dwyer said. The agreement also includes plans to set up a wildlife corridor connecting existing known koala populations in the area. ""More than 100 hectares of land will be planted with eucalyptus, paper bark and other refuge trees, designed to significantly boost the local koala population,"" Mr O'Dwyer said. ""Bottle Tree Hill, which is an existing environmentally significant area, will also be protected in perpetuity."" DES said the deal put an end to extensive enquiries into the matter and would result in about 140 hectares of land for conservation and koala habitat once mining ended at New Acland. It said it would now finalise the matter and monitor compliance at New Acland Coal Mine. The company has also committed to reviewing staff skills, training, and its permit to disturb system. It is currently awaiting approvals from the Queensland government to begin its stage three expansion of the mine.

21,Here's what would happen if Ukraine joined the European Union,business,"  Ukraine is set to become an official candidate for European Union membership, according to ministers and diplomats, in a symbolic but morale-boosting decision after Russia's invasion. EU leaders in Brussels are expected to sign off on last week's recommendation by the European Commission, the EU executive. Emmanuel Macron, Olaf Scholz and Mario Draghi arrive in Kyiv to show their support for Ukraine during the Russian assault. After several days of internal EU discussions, no opposition among the 27 member states has surfaced, three diplomats said. ""We are working towards the point where we tell Russian President Vladimir that Ukraine belongs to Europe, that we will also defend the values that Ukraine defends,"" Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn told reporters before a meeting with other EU ministers. But what would actually happen if Ukraine joined the European Union? Here's a rundown of what a possible membership would look like. The candidacy is the beginning of a process that requires extensive reforms to conform with a host of standards, ranging from judicial policy to financial services and food safety. Still, the EU decision puts Kyiv on course to realise an aspiration that would have been out of reach just months ago. The process consists of several steps, including adopting all of the European Union's laws and regulations. This normally takes a number of years. Lastly, the candidate signs an accession treaty, which all of the other EU countries have to approve. The European Union is a mostly economic and political organisation, not a military alliance like NATO is. This means membership would not necessarily see EU member states directly take up arms in the war with Russia. Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says Ukraine's allies must be prepared for a long conflict and ""must not let up"" in their economic and material support. Still, the membership can make a big economic difference, like it did with Bulgaria and Romania, whose GDP respectively doubled and almost tripled since becoming a part of the EU. On top of that, there are military benefits. The EU has a mutual defence clause, which states that if an EU country is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, other EU countries have an obligation to aid and assist it by all means in their power. Although the candidate status is mainly symbolic, the move will help lift national morale at a very difficult time in a four-month conflict that has killed thousands, displaced millions and flattened towns and cities. If admitted, Ukraine would be the EU's largest country by area and its fifth-most populous. Aside from the 27 European member states that agreed on Ukraine's candidacy, US President Joe Biden has also spoken out about possible membership of the war-torn country, saying it is ""very likely to happen"". ""Ukrainians are ready to die for the European perspective,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. ""We want them to live with us the European dream."" The Dutch government announced it would back Ukraine's EU candidate status, calling the European Commission's advice ""a smart compromise"". ""[Candidate status] is a correct solution from a moral, economic and security perspective,"" Romanian President Klaus Iohannis said alongside French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he believed all European Union members would back granting Ukraine EU candidate status, adding: ""This is like going into the light from the darkness."" In a grievance-filled speech in St Petersburg, Russian President Vladimir Putin railed at the West and the United States in particular, but sought to play down the EU issue. ""We have nothing against it,"" he said. ""It is not a military bloc. It's the right of any country to join economic union."" He also questioned whether it was ""advisable"" for the EU to permit Ukraine to join, saying Kyiv would need huge economic subsidies that other EU members may not be willing to give. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia was closely following Ukraine's EU bid, especially in the light of increased defence cooperation among the 27-member bloc. While the recommendation marks a strategic eastward shift by the EU in the face of Russia's war in Ukraine, Kyiv would likely take years to become a member of the 27-nation union, if at all. Many assumed large-scale, brutal conflict lay in the past, but the 116 days since the Russian invasion of Ukraine have proven massed attrition-style wars may occur in our near future, writes Mick Ryan. EU membership after candidacy is not guaranteed — talks have been stalled for years with Turkey, a candidate since 1999. ""Ukraine has already implemented roughly 70 per cent of EU rules, norms and standards. Yet important work remains to be done, on the rule of law, oligarchs, anti-corruption and fundamental rights,"" Mrs Von der Leyen said. On top of that, Ukraine and Moldova, another candidate, are far poorer than existing EU members, with per capita output around half that of the current poorest, Bulgaria. They also have recent histories of volatile politics, corruption, organised crime and conflicts with Russian-backed separatists. In order to become a member, Ukraine would be required to carry out economic and political reforms and it is unlikely the bloc would take in a country in a state of war. At times of peace, it took Poland, Ukraine's neighbour with similar population size and communist history, 10 years from applying for membership in 1994 to actually joining in 2004. Croatia, Bulgaria and Romania, some of the more recent members, took around 10 years to leave their candidate status, so it might be a while until Ukraine can officially join the union.

22,"Xi Jinping warns of 'alarm for humanity' in Ukraine during virtual summit with Putin, world leaders",business,"  Chinese leader Xi Jinping has said the conflict in Ukraine has ""sounded an alarm for humanity"", and at the same time condemned US-led sanctions against Russia, accusing the West of provoking Moscow. Mr Xi was speaking on Wednesday at the opening of a virtual meeting of the world's leading emerging market economies, namely Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, or ""BRICS"". His keynote speech reinforced China's ongoing support for Russia in the European conflict, and would have come as welcome news to President Vladimir Putin, who was also in attendance. ""The Ukraine crisis has again sounded the alarm for humanity,"" the official Xinhua News Agency quoted Mr Xi as saying. ""Countries will surely end up in security hardships if they place blind faith in their positions of strength, expand military alliances, and seek their own safety at the expense of others,"" he added. In other comments, Mr Xi said imposing sanctions could act as a ""boomerang"" and a ""double-edged sword,"" and that the global community would suffer from ""politicising, mechanising and weaponising"" global economic trends and financial flows. Mr Xi also said China would seek to reduce the damage to international supply chains caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which it has confronted with a hard-line policy of lockdowns and quarantines, despite a diminishing number of cases and the increasing economic cost. Chinese President Xi Jinping reasserted his country's support for Russia on issues of sovereignty and security during a phone call with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. China's increasingly assertive foreign policy and drive to dominate global markets have prompted a backlash in the US, Europe and elsewhere, including calls to replace Chinese suppliers and reduce reliance on the Chinese economy. Mr Xi called for nations to work together on such issues, saying efforts to ""build a small courtyard with high walls"" was in no one's interest. ""Economic globalisation is an objective requirement for the development of productive forces and an irresistible historical trend,"" Mr Xi said. ""Going backwards in history and trying to block other people's road will only block your own road in the end.""

23,Stamp duty cuts would 'put workers where the money is',business,"  West Australian housing land tax reform will boost regions, REIWA says Western Australia's peak real estate body says land tax reform would put workers where the money is being made and encourage movement to the regions. It comes after the New South Wales government announced some first home buyers would be able to choose between paying stamp duty on their properties or an annual land tax from next year. Real Estate Institute of Western Australia deputy president Joe White said he supported the idea. ""We're delighted to see that the recommendations that the various institutes around the country … have put up are starting to get a little bit of discussion within the political bodies,"" he said. Mr White said a land tax would encourage people to take advantage of mining, nursing and teaching opportunities in regional centres without being ""fined"" by stamp duty every time they moved. ""The whole idea is based on the idea of a mobile labour force,"" he said. ""So we don't discourage people from moving to areas where the economy needs them to be."" Want more local news? Sign up for the weekly ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt email newsletter He said replacing large lump-sum stamp duty with the smaller annual cost would allow workers to move for a short time and worry less about making a financial loss on property. First home buyers should be allowed to use their super savings as security for a home loan, according to a parliamentary inquiry into housing affordability. ""It actually encourages movement around the regional centres,"" he said. ""It also encourages movements to regional centres from metropolitan areas."" He said Geraldton in the Midwest and cities throughout the regions would benefit. He said places sush as Geraldton attracted people with specialist mining knowledge. ""Invariably they'll move up while a mine is in the construction phase, but they'll only be there for two years,"" Mr White said. ""A place like Geraldton, the bigger regional centres – Busselton … Hedland, it will encourage people to live in the centre they work rather than just fly-in-fly-out of Perth. He said Perth would also benefit. ""It'll encourage them to move to a regional centre for a few years and then move back rather than just commute or worse, not take the job at all,"" he said. Mr White said the state had a lack of housing development in the regions despite their economic output, which was a ""massive failure"". ""We don't seem to be able to develop regional towns,"" he said. ""We do want to encourage some reasonable development where the money is actually being generated, where we actually need to encourage families to live."" Mr White said it would benefit the broader West Australian population in the long-term. ""The downside is that those that don't move and those with higher value properties will pay more,"" he said. ""But it's a good idea for Western Australians … the idea is that everyone pays a bit more each year, but you don't get hit with a massive cost every time you move.""

24,"Women in WA's FIFO industry victims of 'appalling behaviours', landmark sex assault report finds",business,"  Inquiry into sexual assaults and harassment in WA's FIFO industry urges reporting overhaul, training A scathing report into sexual assault and harassment within WA's fly-in, fly-out mining industry has found women have been subjected to ""an appalling range of behaviours"". Titled 'Enough is Enough', the report details how sexual harassment is ""generally accepted or overlooked"" and describes the ""failure"" of miners to recognise what was happening in their workplaces. Included in the report are stories of several women, including one who was ""knocked unconscious in her donga and awoke to find her jeans and underpants around her ankles"". Another said a man ""forced his hand down her top numerous times in front of other workers, and no one did anything"". Another shocking account details a ""powerplay behaviour"" described as ""shovelling"", where iron ore would be dumped on the cabs of trucks driven by women if they didn’t comply with sexual requests. ""To hear the lived reality of the taunts, attacks and targeted violence, the devastation and despair the victims experienced, the threats or loss of their livelihood that resulted, was shattering and it's completely inexcusable,"" the inquiry's chair, Libby Mettam, told parliament. ""This represents a failure of the industry to protect its workers, and raises real questions about why government was not better across this safety issue,"" she said. The report makes 24 recommendations, including overhauling reporting and training in the sector. A suggestion that surfaced during hearings was an industry-wide ""blacklist"" to prevent known offenders from being employed on other sites, as the inquiry heard was common. But Ms Mettam said that raised issues of confidentiality and natural justice, as well as what the threshold would be for inclusion. ""We have recommended the industry explore options, which could operate effectively and fairly to prevent habitual sexual harassment offenders continuing to be re-employed in the mining workplace,"" she said. ""It is a complex policy issue but it's too important an issue to ignore."" Minister for Women Simone McGurk said the government would consider the recommendations, including the idea of a blacklist, to see whether it was practical. Chamber of Minerals and Energy chief executive Rob Carruthers said the industry was already working to improve its recruitment and vetting procedures, but would consider the idea. ""Any such process needs to be practical and drive better outcomes, so we'd review that in full detail,"" he said. Representing some of the state's biggest miners, Mr Carruthers said it was a ""very challenging day"" for the industry. ""To those that have been impacted by sexual assault and harassment in our industry, on behalf of our industry, I apologise,"" he said. While acknowledging it would take time to digest the report, Mr Carruthers said the industry was already committed to stamping out sexual assault and harassment and would support recommendations which were practical. The report's recommendations include: The inquiry's report also questioned why the industry regulator, the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety, had only received 22 reports of sexual harassment across a seven-year period, despite police investigating 23 in just two years. Senior WA Police reveal the number of sexual harassment claims stemming from mine sites in the state. ""It is difficult to believe the regulator could have accepted this level of reporting as reflecting the true situation on the ground,"" Ms Mettam said. However, she said there had been positive steps made by Worksafe WA, which had issued a new code of conduct naming sexual harassment as unacceptable behaviour, and moved to improve its data collection. But the report also recommended more should be done, particularly to improve the sharing of data between different agencies, including Police and CrimeStoppers. Worksafe only recently took over responsibility for mine safety, and commissioner Darren Kavanagh said work was already underway to help the industry improve and to lift reporting rates. ""I'm confident that with the implementation of [new work health and safety] regulations and clearer reporting obligations, that industry now have that guidance, and so I expect industry will comply with that from now on,"" he said. Committee member and Labor MP for Collie-Preston Jodie Hanns said the core of the problems raised rested with mining companies themselves, and that the job of fixing the issue could not be left to taxpayers. Mark McGowan urges the mining industry to take action in the wake of a report commissioned by Rio Tinto that revealed widespread experiences of sexism, sexual harassment and assault. ""This is a multi-billion-dollar industry, it earns billions of dollars from the resources owned by the people of Western Australia,"" she told WA Parliament. ""The industry has failed in its efforts to do the things it must do, ensure a safe workplace for its workers."" Ms Hanns said the inquiry also led to her realising she would not want her own daughter to work in the mining industry. ""The answer for me is not the laws that we can make as government, it's not the role of Parliament even, it's the very real risk to her safety, to her personal safety, and a risk of sexual assault and sexual harassment,"" she said. ""That should terrify every parent in Western Australia of young girls and women."" Reporting procedures, both internal and external to companies, were another area of concern raised by the report, which called for ""victim-centric procedures"" to deal with complaints. ""We were surprised how many of the people who made submissions to us were ignorant of available reporting systems or clearly mistrusted them,"" Ms Mettam said. ""The key to change is embedding a workplace culture in all mining workforces that does not tolerate sexual assault or abuse, empowering bystanders, like the culture change programs that have addressed physical safety with such success. ""Now it is up to the mining industry and government to seriously address the recommendations in this report. ""It is time to come together to make the cultural, system and legislative changes required to equip, prepare and educate the workforce."" Mines Minister Bill Johnston said the government would stand with and support victims in any way possible, adding the industry had work to do. Ms McGurk said while the issue was not unique to mining, the circumstances of many sites exacerbated the problem. ""This is of course a vicious cycle, where women aren't attracted to work in the industry, let alone stay in the industry, because of the dominance of men and a disregard of women's experiences, but it does need to be addressed,"" she said. She said the government was taking sexual harassment and assault in the workplace seriously, and said it was up to the mining sector to deliver on its promises. The inquiry ran for almost a year, receiving nearly 100 submissions and examining some of the state's biggest miners as well as government regulators. It heard that BHP had terminated the employment of 48 staff for inappropriate conduct over two years while  Rio Tinto had sacked at least 12 people for sexual harassment or assault last year. BHP reveals in the past two years it has sacked 48 workers in relation to inappropriate sexual behaviour. One woman gave evidence she had allegedly been propositioned for sex at two separate mine sites and would only use the gym at 3am when no one else was around. Ahead of Thursday's report, the government-appointed workplace culture expert Elizabeth Shaw reviewed the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety's responses to sexual harassment and assault within the mining industry. Earlier this year, Rio Tinto released an internal review into its culture, which detailed accounts of bullying, racism and sexism. In a statement, the company said it welcomed Thursday's report, as it continues to implement all the recommendations from its own review. ""We will closely study the recommendations contained within the report as we continue to look for ways to prevent disrespectful behaviours in our business,"" iron ore chief executive Simon Trott said. ""While we know we have a long journey ahead to eradicate disrespectful behaviours from our business, we are committed to strengthening our workplace culture for the long term."" After defining sexual assault and harassment as a safety risk in 2018, BHP last year committed to $300 million in security upgrades across its sites, including guards, CCTV and lighting.

25,Remote communities invite big banks to 'come see what it is like' as residents travel 200km to access basic banking,business,"  Banking access for remote Kimberley areas discussed as residents face challenges accessing basic services Residents of remote communities are driving 400-kilometre round trips just to access keycards as solutions are sought to financial and banking issues faced in the bush. Financial regulators, advocacy organisations, banking representatives and an Aboriginal corporation have met in the hope of increasing access to banking services in the Kimberley's remote communities. A roundtable discussion held this week was part of a push by community organisation Broome Circle to bring the financial issues faced by people in remote Aboriginal communities to the attention of the banking industry. Djarindjin Aboriginal Corporation chief executive Nathan McIvor said Aboriginal people in remote communities struggled to access basic banking facilities. ""For example we've got staff in Djarindjin that are having to drive 200 kilometres to Broome just to help somebody access a keycard and then drive back home again,"" he said. ""We can't do that over the phone because a lot of these old people don't talk to people on the phone, they find it very difficult to understand who's on the other side of the line."" Mr McIvor said a representative on behalf of banks could be stationed in remote communities to address financial questions and problems. ""Centrelink has agents in communities, so does Australia Post,"" he said. ""So I wouldn't see any reason why there couldn't be a bank teller or bank agent … in community that can answer the questions that people do have."" Broome Circle financial counsellor Veronica Johnson said she wanted a positive conversation with the banking industry about issues facing remote communities. ""What today was all about was actually all the banks listening to all the good things happening and what good things could be adopted,"" she said. But Ms Johnson said there were a number of issues that needed to be addressed in order to bring basic banking facilities to remote communities. ""They don't have any internet, they don't have enough credit on their phones [for internet and phone banking] and I think the banks need to get on board and visit to see what it's like,"" she said. ""There needs to be more on the ground banks travelling, seeing what people live like in the communities, more outside the box thinking, more collaboration between the banks.""

26,She brought the bikini to Australia and put the Gold Coast on the map. Paula Stafford dies aged 102,business,"  Paula Stafford, the iconic Gold Coast designer who brought the bikini to Australia, dies aged 102 Iconic Gold Coast fashion designer Paula Stafford, who introduced the bikini to Australia, has died at the age of 102. Stafford's fashion empire included swimwear, day and evening wear, and men's wear, and by 1964 it was the second largest industry on the Gold Coast behind sand mining. But when she cut her first one-piece swimsuit in half, Stafford said she had not even ""heard the name 'bikini'"". ""I called mine a two-piece,"" she said in a 2014 interview with the ABC. ""Eventually I learned to call them bikinis. It seemed to be a good marketing idea."" While the bikini was invented in 1946 by Frenchman Louis Réard, Stafford popularised the then-controversial swimwear design and put the Gold Coast on the map in the process. While she made her first two-piece for personal use, Stafford said ""people kept wanting what I was wearing"". ""So I decided it might be a good idea to have an extra income,"" she said. ""I just thought I was doing something normal that I enjoyed doing, and I was so fortunate that all the family came into the business with me."" The bikini surged to prominence in 1952 when a women wearing a Stafford design was ordered to leave a beach for being immodest. Stafford responded by sending five women wearing her bikinis to the beach in what became an infamous PR stunt. ""I never paid for publicity, the media came to me,"" she said. ""It was quite incredible."" Stafford said swimwear became ""an industry"" for her, with her business exporting bikinis to London and New York employing at least 50 women and her family members. ""It grew so rapidly that we had to build a special factory in which to put the machines,"" Stafford said. While her business started with just four machines, it ended with more than 40. The Stafford bikini became synonymous with the Gold Coast at a time the city was considered more of a beachside town. ""It was a lot of work, and time involved in it, but I was happy to do it,"" she said. ""I knew it was going to be a city. I knew it needed promotion. And Australia needed to know about the Gold Coast."" Lydia Pearson from famed Queensland fashion label Easton Pearson told the ABC in 2020 that Stafford was a pioneer in the Australia industry. ""Australia's always been cutting edge for beachwear because our lives revolve around the beach, and so there she was — making the perfect product in the perfect place at the perfect time,"" she said. Stafford was born in 1920 and studied maths, chemistry, and physics at Melbourne Girls Grammar. While she wanted to become an architect, Stafford said the headmistress advised her to pursue a ""more feminine"" career. ""Hence dress design came into the picture,"" she said. Stafford said she gave up the business in the 1990s before it eventually diminished. ""By then I was a bit laissez-faire,"" she said. ""It's no good looking back and saying 'I should have done this, I should have done that'. I did what I did and that was it. ""You can't have regrets, can you.""

27,Europe could be left in the cold as IEA warns of a complete cut-off from Russian gas,business,"  Russia may cut off gas to Europe entirely, planning to redirect trade and oil to BRICS countries instead Russia may cut off gas to Europe entirely as it seeks to bolster its political leverage amid the Ukraine crisis, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA) says, adding that Europe needs to prepare now. ""I wouldn't rule out Russia continuing to find different issues here and there and continuing to find excuses to further reduce gas deliveries to Europe and maybe even cut it off completely,"" IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a statement. ""This is the reason Europe needs contingency plans,"" Mr Birol added, saying a recent reduction in flows may be an attempt to gain political leverage ahead of higher-demand winter months. However, the IEA did not see a full cut-off as the most likely scenario, he added. The European Union has sanctioned Russian oil and coal, but has held off from banning gas imports, due in part to its heavy reliance on supplies from Moscow. In terms of total energy investment for 2022, the IEA said in a report that $2.4 trillion was set to be invested in the sector this year, including record spending on renewables. However, it added that fell short of plugging a supply gap and tackling climate change. Rising 8 per cent from the previous year, when the pandemic was more severe, the investment includes big increases in the electricity sector and efforts to bolster energy efficiency, it said in its annual investment report. Investment in oil and gas, on top of setting back efforts to reach climate goals, could not meet rising demand if energy systems were not retooled towards cleaner technology, it said. ""Today's oil and gas spending is caught between two visions of the future: It is too high for a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C but not enough to satisfy rising demand in a scenario where governments stick with today's policy settings and fail to deliver on their climate pledges,"" the agency said. With Western countries cutting ties with Russian trade and oil, Russia is said to be in the process of rerouting its enegy exports towards countries from the BRICS group of emerging economies. The BRICS countries comprise Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. In order to weather the sanctions, Russia is trying to forge closer ties with Asia, seeking to supplant the markets it lost in the row with the European Union and the United States. In a video address to BRICS Business Forum participants, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was discussing increasing the presence of Chinese cars in the Russian market as well as the opening of Indian supermarket chains. ""In its turn, Russia's presence in the BRICS countries is growing.­­ There has been a noticeable increase in exports of Russian oil to China and India,"" Mr Putin said. According to data from the Chinese General Administration of Customs, China's crude oil imports from Russia were up 55 per cent from a year earlier to a record level in May, displacing Saudi Arabia as China's top supplier, as refiners cashed-in on discounted supplies. Mr Putin also said Russia was developing alternative mechanisms for international financial settlements jointly with its BRICS partners. ""The Russian Financial Messaging System is open for connection with the banks of the BRICS countries. The Russian MIR payment system is expanding its presence. We are exploring the possibility of creating an international reserve currency based on the basket of BRICS currencies,"" he said.

28,Wind farm connection causes lights to flicker across South Australia,business,"  Wind farm's connection to power grid causes lights to flicker across South Australia A connection between Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park and the national electricity grid is under investigation for causing lights to flicker and dim across South Australia for hours this morning. Energy distributor ElectraNet said the privately-owned power generator connected its new wind farm to the grid in South Australia's north about 1:30am, causing a ""voltage issue"". There have been widespread reports of house and street lights flickering across the state as a result. South Australian Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis said the issue was not related to AEMO's gradual end to its intervention to wholesale price caps, which started from 4am and would go for 24 hours. The minister stopped short of assigning blame but said it could be ""a connection issue"". ""We don't know what the actual cause is. We know the source of the problem but we don't know who was causing it,"" he said. ""It could have been [the] renewable energy park, it could have been ElectraNet."" ElectraNet said it worked with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to identify the cause and the third party was disconnected from the network. It said power supplies returned to normal about 5:30am. ElectraNet interim chief executive Rainer Korte said the fluctuations had less of an impact than they otherwise would have because the wind farm generator concerned was only in the commissioning phase. ""We don't like to see these impacts, but the reason we take a cautious approach to commissioning the gradual release of capacity is exactly for this reason — to identify any issues and limit the impact of any issues that may be identified,"" he said. A suspended electricity spot market, rolling blackouts, a ""botched transition"" to renewable energy – these terms were all used to describe SA's 2016/17 energy crisis. Mr Koutsantonis said large operators such as GFG and BHP noticed the ""voltage fluctuations"". He denies there was an inherent problem with renewable energy. ""I don't think it was anything malicious or dangerous. I just think it's probably testing, probably either a new generator that's attempting to establish its connection to the grid after commission,"" he told ABC Radio Adelaide this morning. ""There was testing and as demand started to increase into the day, they pulled the testing and the flickering stopped."" Premier Peter Malinauskas said ElectraNet controlled the transmission lines from power stations to localised networks. ""The transmission lines issue sits with ElectraNet and apparently there's a frequency issue there with one of their feeders,"" he said. ""I understand there is an investigation underway from AEMO with ElectraNet."" AEMO last week suspended the market and directed generators to pump power into the network to keep lights on.

29,"Australian cities fall in global liveability index, Vienna returns to top spot",business,"  Melbourne is Australia's most liveable city, but other state capitals have tumbled down the list Australian cities have tumbled down the global liveability rankings, thanks largely to the wave of COVID-19 infections and lockdowns during 2021. The Austrian capital, Vienna, topped the rankings for the first time since 2019, with Melbourne in 10th spot — the highest-ranked Australian city — and tied with Osaka. Adelaide — which was ranked second in last year's index — has fallen to 30th, Perth has fallen 26 spots to 32nd and Brisbane has dropped 17 spots to 27th. Melbourne had topped the list from 2011 to 2017 before being overtaken by Vienna. The Victorian capital rated highly for education and infrastructure, but was well behind other cities in the top 10 when it came to healthcare. Released by the Economist Intelligence Unit [EIU], the list's researchers assessed more than 170 cities across the categories of stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education, and infrastructure. In its most-recent report, the EIU said the pandemic continued to drive the biggest moves up and down in the liveability index. It said that western European cities that had removed most of their COVID-19 restrictions had made significant climbs up the rankings. ""In Australia, some states were slower to lift restrictions than others. As a result, Perth and Adelaide have lost ground since last year,"" the report said. The impact of the 2021 COVID-19 wave hit New Zealand cities more severely in the rankings, with Auckland dropping from first place in last year's index, to 34th. Wellington fell 46 spots to 50th. The EIU said Australia and New Zealand benefited in early 2021 ""when COVID vaccines were scarce: their closed borders kept cases down, keeping liveability high"". However, due to the COVID-19 wave that struck both countries in late 2021, they ""no longer have a COVID advantage over well-vaccinated European and Canadian cities"", the report said. Victoria's Premier Daniel Andrews said Melbourne had recovered strongly from the difficulties of the pandemic. ""The way we're viewed around the world is important, of course, but all of us know here that Melbourne is back, that Victoria is back,"" he said. Distinguished Professor Billie Giles-Corti from RMIT's Centre for Urban Research said Melbourne's healthcare rating was ""a bit of a nonsense"". ""Austria only has about eight million people, Australia has 25 [million] and they've had 20,000 deaths [from COVID-19], we've had 9,000 deaths,"" she said. ""If COVID is a factor that's contributing to our lower ranking in healthcare, our figures are so much better."" Professor Giles-Corti said there were areas where Vienna was clearly ahead of Melbourne. ""I think one of the things that's really missing out of this index is how sustainable cities are and the ecological footprint of Vienna is much lower than Melbourne's, because it has more public transport,"" she said. ""We have people living on the fringe of our city with no amenity, to me that's more important than this index.""

30,"Victorian earthquake insurance claims spark most complaints after COVID, flooding ",business,"  Earthquake insurance claims generate most complaints after COVID, floods emergency: AFCA Victoria's September 2021 earthquake generated the third-highest number of insurance complaints in the last 12 months after COVID-19 and the flooding in south-east Queensland and New South Wales, according to the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA). As of June 22, AFCA had received more than 350 complaints related to the 5.9 magnitude Mansfield earthquake. This compares to more than 3,700 complaints about COVID and nearly 400 flooding claims. Financial Rights Legal Service acting director of casework Jane Foley believes the true number of people unhappy with the outcome of their earthquake insurance claim could be much higher. ""People get frustrated by the claims process,"" Ms Foley said. ""By the time you've been rejected, and you need to look for an expert, people run out of steam."" Australia is only rocked by damaging earthquakes like today's about twice a year. Here's how. Overall there have been more than 16,000 insurance claims related to the earthquake, valued at approximately $120 million, according to the Insurance Council of Australia. AFCA said most complaints related to home building insurance, with about 60 per cent due to a claim being denied because of a policy exclusion or condition. Other complaints were due to delays, denial of claims for other reasons or disputes over the claim amount. ""The insurer might consider that it's not earthquake damage, but is due to other factors – for example, the damage is pre-existing damage, or the property is too far from the epicentre of the earthquake for it to be the cause,"" AFCA's lead ombudsman for insurance Emma Curtis said. ""If the cause of damage is not clear, we'd expect the insurer to have an engineer's report supporting their decision."" Property damage from Wednesday's earthquake is still to be tallied, as insurance claims appear from three different states and territories. The complaints authority has already closed more than 120 complaints, resulting in insurers paying customers close to $300,000. AFCA says policyholders who disagree with the outcome of an insurance claim should make a complaint to their insurer. If the problem is not resolved within 30 days or a complainant disagrees with the outcome, they can then register the complaint with AFCA. The Financial Rights Legal Centre said they had received a high volume of calls about the Victorian tremor. Ms Foley said earthquake claims could be difficult to assess because it was hard to pin down when a crack occurred and what caused it. ""The obligation is on the policyholder to prove they have experienced loss caused by an insured event,"" she said. ""That's why I would usually recommend getting your own evidence, so you need an expert. ""In Victoria, they don't have enough experts to assess the earthquake damage in a timely manner, so it's hard to prove your case."" For more information about your rights, Ms Foley recommends looking at their earthquake claims guide or the general insurance code of practice.

31,Rex pilots to take industrial action that may affect passengers with 'minor changes' as pay negotiations fail,business,"  Rex Regional Express pilots vote to take industrial action after pay negotiations fail Regional Express Airlines (Rex) pilots have voted to take industrial action over a pay dispute that could affect passengers from Carnarvon to Coffs Harbour and Coober Pedy. In the past week, 230 of Rex's SAAB-340 pilots took part in an online ballot to determine the extent of action against their employer. That ballot concluded on Wednesday. More than 90 per cent of the regional carrier's union member pilots who participated in the vote decided to take action. In response to the decision, Rex said it had ""put in place mitigating measures to ensure our services operate normally."" It followed a breakdown in pay negotiations, during which the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) claimed it had received a deal that was ""worse than previous offers"". That was refuted by a spokesperson for the regional carrier, who labelled the decision to knock back the pay deal as ""beyond belief"". The Rex spokesperson said it offered the pilots a 5 per cent pay increase now, and an additional 8 per cent when the company became profitable. AFAP confirmed they will start taking protected industrial action with three initial work actions, effective from Tuesday June 28. This includes not wearing some, or all, of the uniform. ""In addition to action concerning the wearing of uniforms, pilots will adopt a ban on loading extra fuel prior to flights, where the primary purpose for loading the extra fuel is to negate the need to refuel at the destination airport,"" an AFAP spokesperson said. ""The AFAP remains committed to reaching an agreement and is disappointed that we have had to take this action."" More than 95 per cent of pilots voted to ban working without at least 10 hours break between shifts while away from their home base, and 12 hours when at their home airport. The Rex spokesperson said it was working towards the same goal as AFAP. ""The union and the company are aligned in our desire to not have the travelling public impacted,"" the spokesperson said. ""Especially not during the school holidays when airports are expecting massive delays."" Want more local news? Sign up to the weekly ABC Broken Hill email newsletter The Fair Work Commission has approved eight different industrial actions, all of which were approved by a least a 90 per cent majority of union members. For regional customers worried they might be impacted, law dictates that the AFAP and pilots must provide Rex Regional Express with five days notice of any possible strike action. The Rex spokesperson said passengers could expect ""minor changes to our service delivery, for example the uniform worn may not be the standard one"", as well as the potential for four-hour-long work strikes.

32,Nurses and midwives in NSW to strike next week after budget 'slap in the face',business,"  NSW nurses and midwives to strike next Tuesday in response to budget Nurses and midwives across NSW will walk off the job next week in protest of the state government's recent budget announcements. Members of the NSW Nurses and Midwives' Association from 80 hospitals will stop work for between two and 24 hours next Tuesday. Striking workers at Liverpool and Bankstown Hospital will stop work for 24 hours, while staff at Westmead, Blacktown, Campbelltown, and the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital will walk off the job for 12 hours. The industrial action comes after demands by the union were unmet in yesterday's budget, including pay rises in line with inflation and staff-to-patient ratio requirements. The Royal National Bank has said inflation was likely to reach 7 per cent this year, increasing from 5.1 per cent at present. Public sector workers will receive a 3 per cent pay rise this year, and depending on productivity, a further 0.5 per cent next year. And all healthcare staff will get a $3,000 ""thank you"" bonus for their work during the pandemic. As part of a $4.5 billion package funding the health sector, more than 10,000 extra staff, including 3,517 nurses and 200 midwives will be hired. But Michael Whaites, spokesman for the NSW Nurses and Midwives Association, said the government's offer was like a ""slap in the face"". ""We know that nurses and midwives can't stay if their workloads are not safe,"" Mr Whaites said. ""So, until this parliament enacts nurse-to-patient ratios on a shift-by-shift basis, we will not see the fundamental reform that is needed in our public hospital system."" It will be the third time nurses and midwives have voted to take industrial action this year, after striking for 24 hours in February and March. The industrial action will include a stop work meeting from 2pm at Sydney Town Hall, where members will determine a response to the budget. A union spokesperson has told the ABC that further industrial action was likely. A NSW Health spokesperson said they were ""committed to reaching a resolution"" with the union. ""NSW Health acknowledges and greatly appreciates the nurses and midwives in our public health system for the critical work they do and the difference they make every day,"" the spokesman said. ""The NSW government and NSW Health continue to engage in talks with the union and remain committed to reaching a resolution in the best interests of our patients and our healthcare workers."" The spokesman said all health districts would have plans in place during the strikes to minimise disruption and ensure people in need of emergency care were looked after. Teachers from NSW's public and Catholic schools will go on strike on Thursday, June 30, over a dispute about pay and staff shortages.

33,'I can get my life back': Kerryn is looking forward to the end of the cashless debit card,business,"  Mixed views over federal government's promise to scrap Cashless Debit Card While the new Labor government has promised to scrap the Coalition's controversial Cashless Debit Card, questions remain about what comes next. For Bundaberg single mother Kerryn Griffis, who has been on the card for more than three years, the changes can't come soon enough. ""I'm not anticipating I'll be off it tomorrow or anything like that,"" she told 7.30. ""But the point is I will be getting off it eventually, there is hope for the future and soon I can get my life back."" However, her local federal MP and long-time champion of the card, the Nationals' Keith Pitt, wants the new government to tread carefully. ""They need to talk to the community. You can't make these decisions without consultation,"" he said. ""The feedback that we've been given that's across the community is that it's had a positive impact."" The card was first introduced in South Australia's Ceduna region and Western Australia's East Kimberley in 2016. The trial was later extended to WA's Goldfields, the Northern Territory, and Queensland's Bundaberg/Hervey Bay and Cape York regions. More than 16,000 welfare recipients in these areas have been forced to use a card — operated by the private company Indue — which limited how much cash they could access and prevented the remainder of the benefit from being spent on alcohol and gambling. Labor promised to abolish the card and, after the election, the auditor-general found the program's monitoring and evaluation were ""inadequate"". ""DSS (Department of Social Security) has not demonstrated that the CDC (Cashless Debit Card) program is meeting its intended objectives,"" the auditor-general's report said. The Mayor of Fraser Coast Regional Council, George Seymour, said the findings were upsetting. ""It's almost like they're guinea pigs in this experiment that no-one was actually analysing,"" he said. But East Kimberley Indigenous leader Ian Trust said the feedback he had received over the past few years was mostly positive. ""For a certain target group, such as old people, women and so on, they would be protected from harassment, or they call it 'humbugging' up here, for their money,"" he said. ""I think it had a big impact on gambling."" Mr Trust fears making the card voluntary could make things worse. ""The people who the card should be targeted at are going to be the first ones who are going to put their hand up and say, 'We're wanting to come off,' and they're the ones who probably need more help."" Shelley Bielefeld from Griffith Law School surveyed community leaders and card users in all trial sites and found the Department of Social Services tended to rely on people who supported the card when seeking feedback on its effectiveness. ""Some voices of power holders in communities were given the equivalent of a microphone or megaphone in front of them and some voices were dialled right down in volume,"" she said. Ms Griffis said she found her three years on the card to be a humiliating experience, as she struggled to find enough cash to buy second-hand goods and pay for school activities. ""To tackle the social issues in this town – it's not like a blanket approach, we're going to have this, we're going to control you — people need to be supported,"" the mother of five said. ""All this card did was to push people down when they were already down."" Watch this story on 7.30 tonight on ABC TV and ABC iview.

34,'Unprecedented' construction industry challenges stall council projects,business,"  'Unprecedented' construction industry challenges stall council projects in regional Victoria Pressures on the construction industry are affecting regional Victorian councils' capital works programs and holding up key community projects, builders say. Regional builders say limitations on supplies and skilled labourers are hampering their ability to work Hepburn Shire Council in Western Victoria has reopened the tender for Creswick Town Hall Warrnambool City Council had to contact companies directly to complete a sports pavilion redevelopment project Upgrade works at Creswick Town Hall have been delayed due to a lack of applications for the tender before Hepburn Shire Council's deadline. The Warrnambool City Council faced a similar dilemma earlier this year when no submissions were received for its Jetty Flat Pavilion redevelopment by the closing date in February. This caused delays to the planned construction start date, with the council reaching out to contractors directly to ask if they could complete the project. A tender was finally awarded this month. Regional builders have told the ABC skilled labourer shortages, supply delays, price hikes and high demand were affecting daily work. Richard Nicholson, director of Ballarat-based Nicholson Construction, said many businesses were saying no to new jobs because they were too busy. ""Everyone is trying to get projects that were put on hold and new projects underway — it has all come all at once,"" he said. ""Finding resources … is very challenging."" Abode Restoration director Tom Carson said he would have applied for the Creswick Town Hall tender under different circumstances, because his company previously completed upgrade works at Clunes Town Hall. But he said the company had too much work on to meet council's desired timelines and difficulties accessing skilled workers and supplies meant he had to pass. ""Our business is in Melbourne,"" Mr Carson said. ""We do a fair bit of country work and we have always had the approach to use as many tradesmen in the area [as possible] … but we often find there are just no skilled tradesmen available because they are also flat out."" Mr Carson said Hepburn Shire Council had since reached out to him directly and he was discussing potential changes to the project timeline. Hepburn Shire Council has reopened the tender period for the job for another six weeks. ""It is very unusual — usually we get good numbers of tenders,"" shire chief executive Bradley Thomas said. ""But we have seen the numbers of tenders certainly reduce over the last couple of years. ""It is not just a Hepburn Shire challenge — talking to other councils, it is a challenge right across the sector."" Master Builders Victoria country sector chairperson and Ballarat builder Stuart Allen said the pressure on the construction industry was unlike anything he had seen in 30 years. He said the public needed to be educated on the ""new normal"". ""Where clients used to call up to get a tradesman to do some work straight away, that is not the case anymore because of the shortages,"" Mr Allen said. ""Projects are now taking longer — a nine-month project is now taking 12 months. ""People are caught up in the system as well."" Ballarat-based Renovations and Restorations owner Dan Whitmore said customer expectation on price was an issue and he was having to spend more time quoting jobs. He said the overall number of quote requests had increased, but there was a drop in the uptake of work from those quotes. ""Whilst there are plenty of people looking for renovations to be done, they do get blown away a little when they realise what the price of things are,"" Mr Whitemore said. Mr Allen said cashflow was a major issue for builders because many were locked into contracts for jobs and had to bear the brunt of skyrocketing material prices. ""Businesses can't finish those projects in their allotted times, then they are not being able to collect their money and have the cashflow rolling,"" he said. ""That is putting pressure on being able to pay their suppliers or sub-trades. ""The cost of materials is going up during construction at an unbelievable percentage rate that we have never seen before. ""Some of the materials are going up 20, 30, 40 per cent during construction and builders are locked into fixed-price contracts. ""We are hoping maybe in six months' time there might be a bit of a levelling out of a few of these situations, but it is really hard to say. ""We are hoping, but it is really only a hope."" Mr Nicholson said he was concerned builders going into liquidation could put suppliers and sub-contractors at risk and impact his business in turn, but said the supply issues were ""easing somewhat"". ""The shipping container volumes are starting to increase,"" he said. ""There is a lot more comfort now around the price increases than what there were four months ago. ""We are seeing a little bit more stabilisation of price increases."" Mr Nicholson said the best approach was to get back to work and try and get through the pent-up demand.

35,"Rigid licensing leaves much-needed, qualified livestock truckies sweeping floors",business," ABC Rural Experienced foreign livestock truck drivers at back of licensing queue amid labour crisis Experienced livestock truck drivers emigrating to Australia to fill worker shortages have been frustrated by wait time requirements to access licences. Employers are currently desperate for anyone qualified to work, yet experienced international drivers have been unable to get on the road due to licensing regulations. Mark Thornton is a livestock transporter with 18 years of experience from the United Kingdom, who recently entered the country on a working visa with the intention of finding employment in the industry. He approached the Department of Transport office in Perth, hoping to book a multiple combination heavy vehicle test. Mr Thornton received a heavy rigid licence, which does not allow him to operate livestock transport vehicles, and was told to wait 12 months until he could sit his multiple combination licence. Currently, he is sweeping the garage floors for Mitchell's Livestock Transport. ""They're in a crisis looking for livestock drivers. There's not many people who can drive a lorry with livestock,"" Mr Thornton said. ""If they require me to do a licence test let me do it tomorrow or the next day and have it over and done with. ""If I pass it I should be skilled enough to drive. If I don't pass it, fair enough."" After speaking with another Department of Transport branch, Mr Thornton might be able to sit the multiple combination heavy vehicle test by the end of June. His employer, John Mitchell, the chief executive of Mitchell's Livestock Transport, has been helping him with the process. Mr Mitchell thinks more should be done around licensing issues. ""It's a small win, [but] we need to get some real structural change. It is so easy to make and no risk to the public,"" Mr Mitchell said. He could not believe how difficult the process was to get an experienced driver a licensing test, and both he and Mr Thornton are calling for change. ""It is a bit stupid, to be honest, when you have people here set and ready to do the job but you won't let them do it,"" Mr Mitchell said. ""What is the difference in me driving for 18 years, taking a test today, or taking one in a year's time?"" Mr Thornton said. Mr Mitchell wants experienced drivers to be prioritised, no matter where they came from. ""The last thing we want to do is introduce people onto the road who aren't safe and aren't competent, it is really a no brainer,"" Mr Mitchell said. Livestock and Rural Transport Association of Western Australia chief executive Jan Cooper is lobbying to combat the severe labour shortage. She has asked for rural truck drivers to be added to the Australian Agricultural Visa that was announced last year, and for a review of some of the licensing regulations set by the state government. ""Every driver is important to us at the moment,"" she said. ""If you've got competent people there, who just need a minimum test to get them over the line, then we say 'why shouldn't we be making that happen as quickly as we can?'"" Ms Cooper said. ""What we need at the moment are some problem solvers to sit down and recognise that the industry can't fix this problem without some support from the government.""

36,US begins banning imports from China's Xinjiang over forced labour and genocide allegations,business,"  US implements import ban on goods from China's Xinjiang over allegations of forced labour, genocide against Uyghurs Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the US is rallying its allies against forced labour as it begins implementing an import ban on goods from China's Xinjiang region, where Washington says Beijing is committing genocide. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has begun enforcing the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law in December. CBP has said it is ready to implement the law's ""rebuttable presumption"" that all goods from Xinjiang, where Chinese authorities established detention camps for Uyghurs and other Muslim groups, are made with forced labour and barred from import unless it can be proven otherwise. The agency has said a very high level of evidence would be required for importers to receive an exception to the law. ""We are rallying our allies and partners to make global supply chains free from the use of forced labour, to speak out against atrocities in Xinjiang, and to join us in calling on the government of the PRC [People's Republic of China] to immediately end atrocities and human rights abuses,"" Mr Blinken said in a statement. ""Together with our inter-agency partners, we will continue to engage companies to remind them of US legal obligations."" An Australian Senate committee last year called for the Customs Act to be amended ""to prohibit the import of any goods made wholly or in part with forced labour"". The ABC has contacted the federal government to ask whether Australia plans to support the US move and take its own action. China denies abuses in Xinjiang, a major cotton producer that also supplies much of the world's materials for solar panels. Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said earlier in Beijing that claims of forced labour in Xinjiang were a ""big lie concocted by anti-China forces"". ""With this so-called law, the United States is trying to create forced unemployment in Xinjiang and to push for the world to decouple with China,"" Mr Wang said. The source of the files claims to have hacked and downloaded the documents from several police computer servers in China's far-western region of Xinjiang, before decrypting and leaking them. Beijing initially denied the existence of any detention camps, but then later admitted it had set up ""vocational training centres"" necessary to curb what it said was terrorism, separatism and religious radicalism in Xinjiang. Last week, CBP issued a list of Xinjiang entities presumed to be using forced labour, which includes textile, solar-grade poly silicon, and electronics companies. It has said threatened to ban imports from other countries if related supply chains include products or materials from Xinjiang. The US, Britain and other countries have called for the United Nations' International Labour Organisation to set up a mission to probe alleged labour abuses in Xinjiang. Human rights groups and trade associations that support US domestic producers have warned that goods from Xinjiang could find their way into solar imports from other countries, given the difficulty of verifying supply chains in China. Earlier in June, Mr Biden waived tariffs on solar panels from four South-East Asian nations, leading to accusations his administration was not serious about cracking down on forced labour. CBP could need two years to ramp up enforcement, the breadth of the task making it potentially more difficult than the post-9/11 effort to track terror financing, said Alan Bersin, a former CBP commissioner who is now executive chairman of supply chain technology company Altana AI. ""It comes close to panic in C-suites [executive suites] all across the country where huge enterprises really don't have visibility into their supply chains aside from the direct supplier,"" Mr Bersin said.

37,Coles asks farmers to prove blowout in production costs as it fields pleas for price increases,business," ABC Rural Coles responds to urgent requests for pay increase as production costs blow out for farmers If you are finding it tough paying high prices for fresh food right now, spare a thought for the farmers supplying it. Suppliers' costs went up during the pandemic and energy, labour, shipping and logistics have ballooned again this year due to the war in Ukraine, but suppliers need to negotiate with supermarkets before the price they receive for their products can change. Supermarket giant Coles said it had received five times the usual number of pricing increase appeals from suppliers compared to the same time last year. The company has forecast an ""unprecedented round of pricing increase appeals over the next 12 months from the nation's food and grocery manufacturers"" and said it would review the way it dealt with those requests. In a statement, Coles said, ""A major focus of the review is how suppliers will prove to Coles the size and scope of their own cost increases."" The recent floods have had a dramatic effect on the supply of fresh food and farmers are reeling financially from the wet and cold conditions. In a statement Coles said it had been helping those farmers by increasing the amount it paid for produce. ""There has been a sharp decline in the amount of fresh produce available, with payments for some of the harder-hit categories of fresh produce up by tens of millions."" One Lismore grower who has supplied vegetables to Coles for more than 35 years was badly hit by the flood. Coles said it issued this supplier with a three-year supply agreement ""to demonstrate our confidence in the business and support it through this extremely challenging period"". Jan Harwood from Margaret River Free Range Eggs is one of those struggling with rising production costs. ""Our packaging has gone up 30 per cent in 12 months, [while] the hatchery has just put up their prices by 20 per cent and that's really going to hurt us,"" she said. ""Margins are being cut and we really need to get egg prices up."" Ms Harwood said egg prices in the United States went up 50 per cent last year and she thinks Australia should follow suit. She was also worried about the impact of supermarket chain Woolworths' ""price freeze"" campaign on suppliers. Eggs, oats and dairy products are all on the list of more than 200 home-brand goods that have had their prices ""frozen"". ""I'm really concerned about this announcement because although it seems they're doing something helpful, I don't know how this is going to affect producers supplying those home brands. ""They're already walking a very thin line in terms of profits."" Independent reviewer of the Food and Grocery Code, Chris Leptos, said he was watching the major supermarkets closely. ""I plan to survey 100 per cent of the suppliers to Aldi, Coles, Metcash and Woolworths in September, and I expect to see more positive feedback from the suppliers than I received last year,"" Mr Leptos said. In his last survey, 16 per cent of respondents claimed their wholesaler or retailer had acted unreasonably at times, and 30 per cent said they did not complain about their contracts for fear of reprisal from the supermarkets. Mr Leptos met with the major supermarkets in May to explain that the complaints process in the code was not fit for purpose and a ""less formal and more streamlined complaints process"" was necessary. Woolworths has appointed employment lawyer Helen McKenzie as an arbiter to watch over their dealings with suppliers, while Coles has appointed former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett to do the same. In a letter to Mr Leptos, Coles said it was committed to an ""open relationship with suppliers and proposes to establish a direct line of communication for suppliers"" to raise issues directly with senior Coles staff. The company said it wanted to develop a culture where issues could be raised directly at a senior level. Mr Leptos said he would meet with the arbiters in August to discuss further improvements to the code. Editor's note 22/6/2022: This story has been amended to better reflect the use of fixed-price contracts and to include the support Coles is giving flood-affected farmers.

38,Crown granted approval to operate Sydney casino,business,"  Crown Resorts granted approval to operate Sydney casino Crown Resorts has been given conditional approval to open its Sydney casino, 16 months after being deemed unfit to hold a gaming licence. The NSW Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority (ILGA) has given Crown the green light but says it will closely monitor the casino's initial operations. Last year, ILGA found the gambling giant unfit to hold a gaming licence for the casino at Barangaroo after a months-long public inquiry, which exposed allegations of money laundering. ILGA chair Philip Crawford said Crown had rebuilt its gaming model from the ground up, which has meant deep structural change around governance, anti-money laundering measures and corporate culture. ""After more than one year's work with Crown, the Authority is pleased to have reached a stage where Crown can open its casino operations on a conditional basis,"" Mr Crawford said. He said there had been a ""ground up rebuild"" of Crown, but added the ILGA only granted a conditional license because it had still not found the company ""suitable"". ""The company that went into the Bergin inquiry as Crown has emerged from our discussions over the last 12, 14 months as quite a different company with a lot of different personnel,"" Mr Crawford said. ""In particular their operational procedures and the work we've done on their culture."" However, Mr Crawford says granting a conditional license would allow the ILGA to ""keep a very close eye"" on Crown. ""We want to see them operate,"" he said. ""We want to see that happening so we've retained that independent monitor role. ""At the moment they can't have a complete, unfettered license until we find them suitable."" Mr Crawford said Crown needed to ""blow themselves up to save themselves, and that's pretty much what's happened"". Crown's chief executive officer and managing director, Steve McCann, said it could now finalise opening plans and details would be ""announced shortly"". He said Crown had spent the past 15 months showing the ILGA it had ""the right measures in place"" to open its gaming facilities in Sydney. ""Today is an important day for Crown, our customers and our people, who have been eagerly awaiting this announcement for some time and cannot wait to share the full Crown Sydney experience with the world,"" Mr McCann said. ILGA's initial decision meant the casino section of Crown's skyscraper on Sydney Harbour was blocked from opening, however, the hotel and restaurants within the building have been free to operate. ILGA has also given operating approval to Blackstone, the US private equity group set to take over Crown from June 24. Earlier this month, the Federal Court approved Blackstone's $8.9 billion takeover  bid. Crown's sale means its founder, James Packer, will receive a $3.3 billion payday for his 37 per cent stake. Last year, Crown Resorts made new commitments with the ILGA in a bid to open the casino. It committed to paying a portion of the costs of last year's inquiry, paying a casino supervision levy, ceasing all international junket partnerships, adopting a cashless gaming model and phasing out indoor smoking. Crown is tyring to clean up its image after being fined for illegally promoting gambling in China where 14 staff were jailed, and several damaging inquiries which found the casino operator enabled money laundering and had links to criminal gangs. This month, the Western Australian government found Blackstone suitable to hold a licence for Crown's Perth-based complex. The private equity giant has also passed that hurdle in Victoria, home to Crown's flagship Melbourne casino. Inquiries held in both states delivered scathing findings which had left Crown's future in limbo until the prospective Blackstone sale. In Sydney, Crown's $2.2 billion development at Barangaroo has been mired in controversy. Its ""high-roller"" gaming facility remained closed when despite its restaurants and serviced apartments opening in late 2020. The skyscraper itself, first proposed unsolicited by Mr Packer in 2012, was built on land originally slated as public space. In 2016, the Department of Planning recommended Crown's hotel, casino and apartment complex should go ahead despite some community backlash.

39,AEMO to end its intervention in east coast market,business,"  Australian Energy Market Operator to end its intervention in east coast market An unprecedented intervention in Australia's east coast energy market will be gradually removed over the next day, with authorities increasingly confident in the supply of wholesale electricity. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) last week seized control of the east coast energy market for the first time in its history after days of volatility put several states at risk of blackouts. The federal government backed the intervention, acknowledging the energy market had effectively failed, and credited the AEMO with successfully managing to avoid both blackouts and load shedding as temperatures on the east coast plummeted. AEMO on Tuesday signalled there was sufficient supply to get through Wednesday but confirmed it was still directing generators to pump power into the network. AEMO chief executive Daniel Westerman said the market would begin to set the price from 4am on Thursday, with the market fully reinstated 24 hours later, provided supply was guaranteed. ""We are taking a number of steps operationally and working very closely with generators to make sure that the dysfunctional behaviour doesn't re-occur"" he said. With the electricity sector last week dealing with soaring costs, AEMO initially imposed a price cap and compelled generators to offer their services. But AEMO then suspended the spot market entirely across the national electricity market — which includes Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, NSW and the ACT — saying it was impossible to ensure reliable electricity supply under the current circumstances. ""We put the security of the grid and keeping the lights on above everything else,"" Mr Waterman said. The crisis has been caused, in part, by soaring global coal and gas prices and an ageing fleet of coal-fired power stations in Australia operating below capacity. Even after AEMO has left the market, it has warned the east coast could face challenges maintaining supply and demand. Energy Minister Chris Bowen dubbed AEMO's action's ""prudent"" and endorsed the staged approach to reimposing normal market conditions. ""Risks remain in the system and I know that AEMO remains vigilant about what needs to be cared for in the coming days,"" he said.

41,Grace Tame wants Albanese government to close paedophile superannuation loophole,business,"  Grace Tame wants federal government to close paedophile superannuation loophole Former Australian of the Year Grace Tame is calling on the federal government to close a legal loophole that allows paedophiles to quarantine their superannuation from sexual abuse survivors. Under current rules, victims of crime who seek compensation cannot access funds held in the offender's superannuation account Grace Tame says ""paedophiles should be responsible for compensating their victims"" Under the current rules, victims of crime who launch civil action for compensation against their perpetrators cannot access any funds held in the offender's superannuation accounts. ""Paedophiles are able to hide their assets in their super, which should be available to compensate survivors of abuse,"" she said. ""What this means is that the liability is on the taxpayer to fund the compensation of survivors. ""What needs to change is that paedophiles should be responsible for compensating their victims."" Victims' advocate Howard Brown said the issue came to light in 2017, when the victims of convicted Bega Valley paedophile Maurice Van Ryn discovered they would be unable to access hundreds of thousands of dollars he had in superannuation through a civil compensation claim. ""We found that [Van Ryn] was virtually [penniless] as he had placed all his funds into his superannuation account,"" Mr Brown said. ""And [Van Ryn] basically said to us: 'Everything I have is in my superannuation account, and you can't touch that.' ""And of course, he was correct – we couldn't."" In 2018 then-financial services minister Kelly O'Dwyer promised legislative changes to give victims access to their perpetrators' superannuation for compensation, but the plan stalled. Adelaide-based lawyer Andrew Carpenter has been pushing for the reform to be introduced since 2020. ""It's going to save the taxpayer, it's going to punish offenders, and it's going to finally be something that compensates survivors,"" Mr Carpenter said. Mr Carpenter has joined with the Grace Tame Foundation, established by the 2021 Australian of the Year, as well as Fighters Against Child Abuse Australia and the Carly Ryan Foundation to lobby the new Labor government to introduce superannuation reform. Labor was asked for comment on this reform while in opposition, but has not made any commitments. Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said in a statement: ""I have not yet had the opportunity to discuss Ms Tame's proposal with her."" ""The government would welcome a discussion on how we can support survivors and the role that each level of government should play,"" he said. The Grace Tame Foundation, Fighters Against Childhood Abuse Australia, and the Carly Ryan Foundation have written to the Assistant Treasurer to request a meeting. Ms Tame said the legal loophole was another example of a system stacked against victim-survivors of sexual abuse. ""It's really important for people to understand the fundamental power imbalance between survivors and paedophiles,"" she said. ""Where we seem to keep going wrong is in simplifying it to one between individuals – it isn't. ""And [this is] a classic example of systems abuse that remains unchanged. ""Instead of thinking of it in terms of individual perpetrators and individual victims, it is [actually] individual victims versus an entire machine."" Mr Carpenter said it was not uncommon for convicted perpetrators to dispose of their assets before going to prison. He said this happened in the case of Adelaide woman Melissa Snelling, whose adoptive father Robert Snelling was jailed in 2019 for sexually abusing her as a child. ""Out of 10 years of doing survivor-victim claims, the case of Melissa Snelling was probably the hardest one I've been involved in,"" he said. ""That was the most heinous and abhorrent case of child exploitation that I've ever seen."" Mr Carpenter said before Snelling was jailed he attempted to sell his house to his son for $22,000 but was ordered to transfer the house to Melissa as part of the court ruling. ""That [house] was easy to claw back,"" he said. ""But when people have superannuation, that's something that's almost impossible to claw back. ""And that's something that this change will effectively do."" Ms Snelling said the persistent sexual abuse she suffered as a child had left her with ongoing mental and physical pain that no amount of financial compensation would fix. ""My life is seeing doctors, seeing psychologists, seeing counsellors, having support workers,"" she said. ""The judge presided over a certain amount and the derelict family home was sold and I was then put in a position to receive some of that money. But it cost me over $100,000 in legal fees. ""How do I keep maintaining financial security, when I've struggled all my life and I haven't had a career and I've got no superannuation to fall back on?"" Ms Snelling said the current system seemed unfair. ""It is seriously wrong,"" she said. ""It means they can come out of jail and set themselves back up again. ""Why do they deserve the right to be set back up again when they've given someone a sentence for life?"" Mr Brown said he hoped Anthony Albanese's federal government would consider the reform. ""I would be calling on the government to at least go back through Treasury, look at the discussion paper and the responses that they received to that discussion paper, and then make a decision themselves as to whether they can move forward from the results of that inquiry, or whether they need to call a new inquiry,"" he said. ""But what I would be saying is that time is of the essence, because unfortunately we don't get to save every victim. ""And if we can get a system in place where we can at least have financial assistance to victims so that they can receive proper treatment, then we are going to lose less victims."" Mr Brown acknowledged that one of the concerns raised in the past was that offenders would leave prison with no savings. ""One of the issues which I understand was a stumbling point for the previous Morrison government was that there was some concern that if we were to deplete a person's superannuation, they would then become dependent upon the government so that then the government would be seen as paying perpetrators a pension,"" he said. ""I didn't believe that that was a substantive issue, to be honest, because we would not be looking to deplete a person's superannuation. ""But we would be looking for reasonable compensation.""

42,Smash 'em and eat 'em: Growers desperately need you to eat more avocados,business," ABC Rural Avocado oversupply prompts calls for Australians to stock up while they're cheap Struggling avocado growers are appealing to customers to smash their way through a glut of cheap fruit before it sends many in the industry to the wall. Avocado supply is outstripping demand across the country leaving many growers struggling to make a profit. Avocados Australia chief executive John Tyas said the industry was desperate to lift the domestic and international intake of the fruit. ""Australians are some of the highest consumers of avocados in the world already but we need to ramp that up further,"" he said. ""[Australians] were eating around 4 kilograms of avocados per person in 2021, but we need to be getting up to around 5 to 6kg."" Mr Tyas said almost 80 per cent of Australian households ate avocados but there was still room to grow. The oversupply situation is set to worsen due to hundreds of new avocado trees that were planted within the past decade coming into production, adding to the surplus of fruit. Farmer Nola Stumm said she was worried about the future of her 160-hectare avocado farm at Comboyne on New South Wales' Mid North Coast. ""We've got a lot of young plantings that are coming into the market [but] we've already got plenty of fruit about,"" she said. ""So we need people to be eating lots of Australian avocados. ""We also want to grow our exports but currently only Western Australia is having success accessing new markets."" Mr Tyas said WA's crop was down from last year, which was good news for east coast growers. ""As we come into spring and summer we'll see supply volumes taper off,"" he said. ""I suppose there's a bit of a reprieve for east coast growers coming later this year. ""But longer term, you will most likely see massive volumes once again around the country and that trend is going to continue for the next few years to come."" From steak to tacos, here are 11 recipes to make the most of the avocado glut. Avocados Australia is also working to access and develop new export markets. WA growers recently gained access to the Japanese market and are set to send their first consignment as early as this week. Mr Tyas said east coast growers were not yet included in the trade deal due to the presence of Queensland fruit fly. ""In WA, they have a species called the Mediterranean fruit fly and lots of countries around the world have that species, so there's been lots of research over many, many years on market access protocols,"" he said. ""On the east coast, we have Queensland fruit fly, which is only found in Australia."" From being smart about shopping for everyday items to making lifestyle changes to save on power, our readers share ways you can cut costs. Mr Tyas said there had been a lot more research in recent years involving the Queensland fruit fly, which he was confident would underpin protocols enabling access to regions that already had the pest. ""Now that we've got that, we want to push on and really get the Australian government to negotiate these protocols for us,"" he said. ""Because once the east coast has got access, we'll be able to supply that market year-round."" The organisation is also looking to export to India and Thailand, as well as expand its already established trade with Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong. Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries extension horticulturist Simon Newett said growers needed to focus on fruit quality, which had been negatively impacted by prolonged wet weather, for Australian avocados to become a strong player in the global market. ""If you export bad quality food, we're going to get a very bad name overseas,"" Mr Newett said. ""We're going to shoot ourselves in the foot. ""And this season, the way it's been with all the rain and overcast conditions, [it] has made it even more challenging to get that good quality product.""

43,World's biggest Indian sandalwood plantation starts new planting cycle since going into administration,business,"  Sandalwood giant Quintis starts fresh chapter with first WA plantings since restructure Sandalwood giant Quintis has planted its first new trees in five years, in what the once-embattled supplier hopes is a new cycle of longevity. By July, more than 165,000 Indian sandalwood trees and 476,000 host trees will have been hand planted across 327 hectares at Quintis's Packsaddle plantation near Kununurra in northern Western Australia. The sandalwood will grow for 15 to 20 years before its highly valued heartwood is harvested for use in a range of fragrances, cosmetics, traditional medicines, furniture, and handicrafts. It is the first time the producer of exotic timber, which manages the largest Indian sandalwood plantation area in the world, has planted new trees since before it went into administration in early 2018 following the cancellation of major contracts. After recapitalising as a private company and a record harvest last year, Quintis head forester Troy Sawyer said investment in a new sandalwood rotation marked another significant milestone for the company. ""It's time to really start that next cycle of our journey and the plantations that will take Quintis into the future,"" he said. ""We're confident in our markets, we're confident in the quality of the product of our plantations, and that we can develop new plantations."" Some 60,000 trees sown at the irrigated site during 2007 are also being harvested. It will be Quintis's largest harvest since it planted its first commercial sandalwood trees in 1999. ""Our harvest evolves every year; it's getting bigger and bigger,"" Mr Sawyer said. With 15 years of trials and research between the planting of the two crops, Mr Sawyer said the company had made several improvements to the way it grew sandalwood in northern Australia. While initial results from this year's harvest pointed to positive yields, he was confident future crops would realise further potential. ""We've learnt a lot from the first rotation of plantations,"" Mr Sawyer said. ""We think that the trees and the genetics that we're putting back into the ground now will have a far greater yield and perform far better in this climate than the first rotation of trees. ""We're really looking forward to that sustainability, where we can turn the plantations over and we can harvest them at one end of the rotation, and replant them at the other end."" After the timber is processed at its Kununurra facility, much of Quintis's high-quality timber will be transported more than 3,500 kilometres away to its Mount Romance sandalwood oil distillery near Albany. Quintis manages about 12,000 hectares of Indian sandalwood plantations, with operations in the Northern Territory and Queensland. Its Kununurra site is the only plantation where planting will recommence this year. ABC Kimberley will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Tuesday. Sign up to stay connected.

44,Saltwater salads on the menu helps fix Australia's damaged farmland,business," ABC Rural Growing salt-tolerant plants will fix land damaged due to European farming methods, WA farmer says Tucked away in a tree plantation south-east of Perth, a saltwater greenhouse that may be one of a kind is growing salty plants for innovative restaurants. ""I don't know anyone in Australia who's done it,"" Katanning farmer and owner of Moojepin Foods, David Thompson said of the saltwater hydroponic system. He installed the system in 2020 — four years after starting the business — to grow new species of salt-tolerant plants for food. Mr Thompson started collecting saltbush, which grows naturally on his salt-damaged farm. Salt is a plague in low-lying regional areas, rising up from the groundwater after more than a century of land clearing for farming. But for these plants, the water is not salty enough. ""We're about 20 per cent seawater. We'd rather be 50 per cent,"" Mr Thompson said. ""I think it would give the plants more flavour."" The greenhouse grows a variety of native and overseas species of salt-tolerant plants for restaurants around the country. The plants give a salty kick to seafood, tacos, salads and meat dishes. ""Saltbush is extremely versatile,"" Young George restaurant chef and owner Melissa Palinkas said. ""Fresh leaves can be made into a pesto, dried into a rub for meats complemented by other native Australian herbs."" she said. In addition to the greenhouse, Mr Thompson farms hardier saltbush species on his salt-damaged farmland. Some of the species are known to the Indigenous people in the region and considered cultural property. Mr Thompson said he found the edible species by tasting the plants on his farm. ""Salinity is a problem that's arisen due to European farming methods, and we have to find a solution to fixing the land,"" he said. Dryland salinity is spreading every year across regional Australia, killing crops and native bush as more salt rises from the ground. In WA alone, the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) estimated that $519 million of farming production was lost to salt damage annually, with more than 2 million hectares of land still under threat. DPIRD principal research scientist Richard George said the problem was brought about by agricultural land clearing. Dr George said researchers had spent decades experimenting with saltbush as a way to combat rising salinity. In 2015, DPIRD and the CSIRO identified an edible species suitable for livestock grazing and remediating saline land, with millions of seedlings now planted around Australia each year. ""Saltbush moderates the depth of the water table [and can be] sufficient to regain salt-sensitive species in the pasture,"" Dr George said. ""That response is capable of being adopted probably across 30 per cent to half of the Wheatbelt salinity."" Dr George supported Mr Thompson's plan to cultivate more saltbush for human consumption. ""I think this may be a way forward. We've just got to do it slowly,"" Mr Thompson said. ""The big challenge we've got is to get it into everyday Australian cuisine.""

45,Twitter board 'unanimously' endorses Elon Musk's $63 billion takeover bid,business,"  Twitter board 'unanimously' endorses Elon Musk's $63 billion takeover bid to shareholders Twitter's board has recommended unanimously that shareholders approve the proposed $US44 billion (more than $63 billion) sale of the company to billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The announcement was made in a regulatory filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday. Mr Musk reiterated his desire to move forward with the acquisition last week during a virtual meeting with Twitter employees, though shares of Twitter remain far below his offering price, signalling considerable doubt that it will happen. On Tuesday at the Qatar Economic Forum in an interview with Bloomberg, Mr Musk listed the approval of the deal by shareholders as one of several ""unresolved matters"" related to the Twitter deal. Shares of Twitter were essentially flat just before the opening bell on Tuesday and far short of the $US54.20 per share that Mr Musk has offered to pay for each. The company's stock last reached that level on April 5 when it offered Mr Musk a seat on the board before he had offered to buy all of Twitter. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday detailing a letter to investors, Twitter's board of directors said it ""unanimously recommends that you vote [for] the adoption of the merger agreement"". If the deal was to close now, investors in the company would pocket a profit of $US15.22 for each share they own.

46,AgForce Queensland boss questions climate science despite pressure to cut emissions ,business," ABC Rural AgForce chief Michael Guerin questions climate science, blasts NZ pledge to cut farm emissions The head of Queensland's peak rural lobby group AgForce says the science is not settled on climate change as he criticises New Zealand's plan to reduce agricultural emissions. New Zealand farmers have worked with government on a proposed farm-level levy system as an alternative to the industry being included in the country's emissions trading scheme. Queensland AgForce chief executive Michael Guerin said he was ""horrified"" by the plan. ""One of the things I believe very strongly, having spent a lot of time working with scientists — and I'm not a scientist — but the belief I have is that the science is never settled,"" he said. ""By its very definition it's a process of continuous learning, so climate change is real [but] it's coming from a number of sources, the scientists tell us. ""There are a lot of examples where things have been decided in the past where [they have] changed their mind with updated science."" He said his personal views on climate change did not affect the work he did in his role representing the state's farmers. ""What I do is represent now about 6,500 members, and through a committee process represent their collective views into the core issues,"" he said. ""There are various views about where climate change comes from, but there's an unanimous view that we want to work collaboratively and productively with science and with government in some of these issues."" Sunshine Coast farmer Kerrie McMartin, a member of Farmers for Climate Action, said climate change had significantly affected her family's operation. ""Just because it's not your reality it doesn't mean it's not somebody else's reality,"" she said. ""So on our particular farm here we are very affected by climate change, and to us it is very, very evident that it's man-made."" Ms McMartin runs a mixed horticulture and sugarcane farm at Bli Bli that grows lychees and custard apples commercially, and has a small pick-your-own strawberry farm. ""Dad's been here for 77 years and he's seeing a lot of changes. The patterns that you would see over a period of time, they're changing, the temperatures are changing,"" she said. She said the farm on the Maroochy River has lost one paddock to salt inundation and one of its dams was ""very vulnerable"". ""It's almost a completely different style of farming now,"" she said. ""They used to dry farm, everything. They would grow watermelon, they grew green beans everywhere, and nothing was irrigated."" Now irrigation was required, and temperature changes had increased pests. ""Our summer bugs are now all-year-round bugs, so we now have to be spraying all-year-round,"" she said. She said the agriculture industry was ""quite proactive"" on emissions reductions, but there was more to be done. ""I actually think what they're doing in New Zealand is a result of desperation. They desperately want to change the narrative of what is actually happening,"" she said. ""They're willing to do something. I think that's amazing, and it should be applauded."" Ms McMartin said even smaller emissions cuts were beneficial. ""So, while we're seeing catastrophic events take place, which are wiping out crops all over the country, we've also got to take responsibility,"" she said. ""We use a lot of chicken manure on our farm, so it cuts down our superphosphate and our urea, and fossil fuel fertilisers."" ""I'd like to see government really step up and not just go OK, we've got until 2050 to sort this out. I'd like them to start sorting it out now."" Mr Guerin said agriculture was the only industry in Australia that had made a tangible reduction in net emissions since 1995, but he acknowledged there was more to do. ""It's a powerfully positive story that can be accelerated through incentives, rather than slowed up through taxes,"" he said. He said grazing animals contributed to carbon sequestration and a new project, AgCarE (Agriculture, Carbon and the Environment), demonstrated that much of Queensland's cattle industry was positive sequesters. ""Our view is that we need to continue to work in that vein because the broader community all have the same ambition, which is to look after the planet [and] leave in a better state for next generation,"" Mr Guerin said.

The ASX 200 closed 0.2 per cent lower, at 6,509 points on Wednesday. The Australian dollar was trading at 69.1 US cents, following a 0.9 per cent drop at 4:20pm AEST. Bitcoin last traded at $US20,158, and has dropped by about 70 per cent since its record high in November. Philip Lowe has warned Australians they need to be prepared for substantial interest rate rises over the rest of this year, conceding he is not sure how high they might go. Investors continued to assess how worried they need to be about central banks pushing the global economy into recession as they attempt to curb red hot inflation with interest rate hikes. Invesco's global market strategist for Asia Pacific David Chao believes ""global equity markets could end higher at the end of the year than where we are today"". But he warned investors could ""expect continued market volatility until it becomes clear that the Fed [US Federal Reserve] is not going to force the US economy into contraction in order to tamp down persistent levels of inflation."" The latest inflation figures from the United Kingdom added to investors' concerns. At its peak, the ASX 200 had risen by 0.5 per cent in morning trade, before the enthusiasm began to fade. The index ultimately finished its day with a 0.2 per cent loss. The Australian share market has dropped by more than 15 per cent from its record high, sliding closer towards a bear market. Some investors may be tempted to ""buy the dip"", but analysts say there is ""further downside"" ahead. The local bourse was also in correction territory, having dropped by 15 per cent since its record high in August. Some of today's best performing stocks were Iress (+4.5pc), REA Group (+3.9pc), APA Group (+4.2pc), Ampol (+3.8pc) and Orica (+3.4pc). On the flip side, Blackmores (-8.9pc), Imugene (-9.4pc), and stocks in the local tech sector Zip Co (-11.4pc) and Life360 (-4.4pc) suffered heavy falls. Zip's share price sank despite the buy now, pay later firm releasing an announcement, in an attempt to reassure investors. The company said its ""underlying business remains strong"" and its takeover of rival Sezzle will head to a shareholder vote ""later this calendar year"". Shares of local fintech Humm Group fell 3.8 per cent, after the company's majority directors agreed to resign. It comes days after payments firm Latitude withdrew its offer to take over Humm, in a deal worth $335 million. St Barbara shares plunged 18.1 per cent, to a seven-year low, after the gold miner provided a downbeat trading update. The miner said it will defer its final investment decision in regards to its Simberi mine in Papua New Guinea. Instead, it will conduct a ""strategic review"" on whether to extend the life of that mine. The company also flagged there was a ""near-term risk of disruption"" to its Touquoy, north-east of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. New South Wales' gaming regulator has has given Crown Resorts conditional approval to open its gaming operations at its casino in Barangaroo, Sydney. It comes days after Crown's $8.9 billion takeover by Blackstone received court approval. The Sydney casino, part of a 75-floor tower complex which opened in December 2020, had its licence suspended by the Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority (ILGA) just before opening in late 2020, following media reports of its alleged dealings with organised crime groups. The ILGA, which oversees Crown's Sydney licence, said it is now ""pleased to have reached a stage where Crown can open its casino operations on a conditional basis."" Crown's Melbourne resort remains under government supervision. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 gained 2.5 per cent, to close at 3,765 points.

Oil and gas stocks were among the best performers, while megacap stocks Apple, Tesla, and Microsoft all rose sharply to boost the market. The S&P 500 earlier this month fell over 20 per cent from its January record high, confirming the common definition of a bear market. Last week, US markets suffered their biggest weekly sell-off since March 2020. ""Do I think we have hit bottom? No, I think we are going to see more volatility,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. ""I think the bottoming process will likely take some time."" Investors are trying to assess how far stocks can fall as they weigh risks to the economy with the US Federal Reserve taking aggressive measures to try to tamp down surging inflation. The Fed last week approved its largest interest rate increase since 1994 to stem a surge in inflation. Investors are pivoting to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony to the US Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday (local time) for clues on future interest rate hikes and his latest views on the economy. Investors are ""trying to read the tea leaves to see how aggressive the Fed is going to get,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.

48,live: NSW now: Sydney Airport predicts 2.1 million passengers during July holidays,business,"  Sydney news: More than 2.1 million passengers forecast to flood Sydney Airport in July school holidays Here's what you need to know this morning. More than 2.1 million passengers are expected to fly in and out of Sydney Airport during the July school holidays. The forecast includes 1.5 million domestic customers and 560,000 international passengers. That's an increase of 300,000 people compared to the April period, when the airport struggled with massive delays. Sydney Airport chief executive Geoff Culbert welcomed increasing passenger numbers but warned it would make for long waits. ""It's terrific to see the ongoing demand for air travel but we won't sugar-coat the fact that the terminals will be busy during the school holidays, and there will be queues,"" he said. ""We are doing everything we can to get people on their way, including bringing an additional 60 customer service staff into the terminals every day to help manage queues and bring passengers forward in order of flight priority."" The airport says passenger traffic has recovered to 69 per cent of pre-pandemic levels. Passengers are advised to arrive two hours prior to departure for domestic flights, and three hours before international flights, unless advised otherwise by their airline. Foot traffic is expected to peak on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, with the latter slated to be the busiest days. Detectives are investigating the death of a man and woman after their bodies were found inside a home on the Central Coast yesterday. As of last night, the bodies were yet to be formally identified but were believed to be both aged in their 80s. Emergency services found the bodies yesterday afternoon while responding to a welfare report at a residence on Maidens Brush Rd, Wyoming. A report will be prepared for the coroner. Police have asked anyone who may have information that could assist detectives to contact Crime Stoppers. Opal fares will increase by an average of 3 per cent across Sydney from next month. The $50 a week cap for adults, $25 a week cap for youth and concession holders along with the $2.50 daily cap for pensioners will remain. Transport for NSW chief operations officer Howard Collins said the increase had been kept to a minimum, and was below the 5 per cent rise recommended by the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal. A man was rushed to hospital with serious burns after an explosion in a Parramatta kitchen last night. Emergency services were called to a restaurant on River Road West and found the man suffering from multiple injuries. NSW Ambulance Inspector Brian Parsell said the 23-year-old man was transported to Concord Hospital with burns to his head, both arms and chest. ""We believe that the burns occurred following an explosion in a restaurant where the gentleman was working,"" he said. Police and Fire and Rescue NSW are investigating the cause of the explosion. Inmates at NSW jails will be provided with a deck of playing cards featuring pictures of cold case murder victims in a bid to potentially jog some memories. Each deck contains cards displaying a photograph and information about an unsolved homicide or suspicious disappearance. Deputy Premier and Police Minister Paul Toole said the initiative had been planned over many years in close consultation with the victims' families. ""Today is about honouring the memories of victims, supporting their families in their search for justice, and encouraging inmates with crucial information to come forward,"" he said. NSW Police Force Homicide Squad Commander Detective Superintendent Danny Doherty hoped the cards would generate new leads by circulating crucial information about suspected victims among inmates. ""This format has already had success in the United States and other jurisdictions here in Australia, and we have worked collaboratively under Operation Veritas for almost two years to ensure we get it right,"" he said. ""We know inmates often share details of their crimes or those committed by associates with others; this is about capitalising on that and generating new information to progress these cases."" The NSW government will seek to strengthen bail laws, which allow some accused criminals to live in the community while awaiting their court appearances. Two amendments to the Bail Act 2013 are due to be raised in Parliament this week. The first is that bail must be refused following conviction or a guilty plea and prior to sentencing, where the offender will be sentenced to full-time detention, unless special or exceptional circumstances can be established. The second amendment will require electronic monitoring systems to meet a certain standard. ""Getting our bail laws right is a delicate balancing exercise,"" said a statement from Attorney-General Mark Speakman's office. ""Where there are opportunities for improvement, the NSW government is committed to acting swiftly and decisively, to protect our community and support our frontline services in keeping our community safe, as we are doing this week.""

49,'Some kids don't go to school': One of Queensland’s most expensive cities is crying out for public transport,business,"  Mount Isa residents crying out for public transport in one of Queensland's most expensive cities Concern for child safety, poor school attendance, difficulty accessing the workforce, and a financial burden on residents — the ripple effect of a lack of public transport is far-reaching in the rural city of Mount Isa. The mining town of 20,000 residents has earned a name as one of the most expensive places to live in Queensland. That is partly due to the lack of public transport driving up the cost of living, data from the Queensland Council of Social Services shows. A new report, The Mount Isa Transport Scoping Paper, is the first of its kind to spell out the impacts on the town with advocates hoping it will set the wheels in motion for a solution. Debra Woodward from youth support organisation Young People Ahead (YPA) said the situation was at breaking point. ""Something needs to change. So many people are being affected,"" she said. Walking several kilometres to school in 40-degree Celsius heat is the norm for some Mount Isa students, while volatile family situations in vulnerable sections of the community mean some children do not make it to class most days. ""We looked at how can we get kids engaged with school [and] one of the biggest barriers was public transport,"" Father Mick Lowcock, founder of North West Queensland Indigenous Catholic Social Services (NWQICS), said. NWQICS commissioned the report on the community's lack of public transport. ""If you're a kid in a situation where your guardians are fighting with each other, often it means you don't get a lift to school. That is something that is forgotten about,"" he said. Ms Woodward said the heat was also a contributing factor. ""Some kids don't go to school as often as they should because of the distance they have to walk in our excruciating heat,"" she said. Principal at Good Shepherd Catholic College, Kathleen McCarthy, said a public transport option would make the city a safer and more liveable place for families. ""Many of our students ride bikes or walk to school but this can be unsafe, especially with the large volume of heavy vehicles through town,"" Ms McCarthy said. ""There are also some safety concerns with students needing to walk home alone."" A spokesperson for the Ngukuthati Child and Family Centre said a private bus service used for their clients was struggling to keep up with demand. ""We still have kids who want to attend school but are currently on a waiting list due to not having enough buses available to transport them,"" they said. A lack of cheap, accessible transport has been a major barrier for those attempting to get into the workforce. ""With some of the young people here, we try and get them a bike [to ride to work], but even riding a bike in the summer here is really hard work,"" Ms Woodward said. Pensioners and those with disabilities were also some of the worst off when it came to travelling around town. Ms Woodward said some residents took taxis to pick up groceries or attend health appointments, with the cost of fares eating into already stretched-thin budgets. ""It's a $10 to $15 cab ride for some vulnerable members of our community to pick up their groceries or go to a health appointment,"" she said. Fr Lowcock hoped the study would spark conversations between key stakeholders including the Department of Transport and Main Roads and Mount Isa City Council. ""With this study, we can start working towards a solution. We have something tangible we can go to the government and state our case with,"" he said. A spokesperson for the Department of Transport and Main Roads said: ""Providing these services comes at considerable cost to the government"". ""Investment is dependent on several factors including population density, demand, suitability of local infrastructure, funding availability, and competing priorities across the state,"" they said. Mount Isa Mayor Danielle Slade said the council was prepared to advocate for the idea. ""We are prepared to write a letter to the minister [for transport] as we would need funding for a public transport option due to the small size of our rate base,"" she said. ""If we were to look at public transport, what would the model look like? Where would the funding come? That would be the next step for the council and we do acknowledge that public transport would mean a great deal to our community.""

50,Half the cost but only 6pc of the benefit? Tasmania's obstacle to Marinus Link,business,"  No guarantee Tasmanian households won't be hardest hit by Marinus Link bill It was the hot topic of letters between former prime minister Scott Morrison and the Tasmanian government — and it appears there's still no guarantee Australia's poorest state won't pay half the cost of a massive new power project and reap a fraction of the benefits. Marinus Link is a $3.5 billion plan to build two new undersea power cables between Tasmania and Victoria Most of the benefits will go to mainland power users, but under current rules Tasmanians will have to pay half the cost of Marinus Link Former prime minister Scott Morrison told the Tasmanian government last December he doubted that rule could be changed in time for Marinus Link to be built on schedule The undersea electricity interconnectors and new transmission infrastructure between Tasmania and Victoria, dubbed Marinus Link, are estimated to cost $3.5 billion to build. The Commonwealth and Tasmanian Governments have already committed over $200 million to pay for feasibility studies and a business case, and a Final Investment Decision is set for 2024. But both governments privately acknowledged most of the benefits will go to mainland electricity customers and Tasmanian energy generators, including Hydro Tasmania and wind farm owners, and not to Tasmanian consumers. This was made clear in a letter from former Tasmanian premier Will Hodgman and current Energy Minister Guy Barnett to then prime minister Scott Morrison, made public under a Right to Information request. ""Given the overwhelming majority of benefits from Project Marinus will flow to National Electricity Market (NEM) regions other than Tasmania, the Tasmanian government cannot justify a funding scenario in which Tasmanian taxpayers or electricity customers incur additional costs to benefit other NEM regions,"" they wrote. Mr Hodgman and Mr Barnett were making it clear to Mr Morrison that a way would have to be found to ensure Tasmanians didn't have to pay for half of Marinus Link since they wouldn't get half of the benefits. But Mr Morrison wasn't certain that could happen before a final decision was made on whether to build the new interconnectors. Marinus Link is proposed to be a regulated interconnector — that means the investors who pay for it to be built will get a guarantee they will be repaid whatever money they put in, as well as a set extra return on top of that. The suspension of Australia's east coast energy market could be lifted as early as Thursday, but the market operator is warning the challenges managing supply and demand may continue. Goanna Energy principal consultant Marc White said under Australia's current energy market rules, it would be power users like households and businesses that would have to pay the investors back through higher electricity bills. ""The question is where is that money coming from and, the answer is — as a regulated interconnector  — that money is coming from consumers to repay the capital and to provide a return on that capital to investors,"" he said. Under the Australian energy market rules, the costs of interconnectors, or electricity transmission cables between states, are shared equally between the states that are connected. That means Tasmanian consumers would be up for 50 per cent of the cost of Marinus Link. TasNetworks, which is managing the Marinus Link project, has acknowledged Tasmanian consumers will get about 6 per cent of the benefit, with 94 per cent going to other stakeholders including generators and interstate consumers. ""Under the current market rules, paying 50 per cent for an asset that we only get 6 per cent benefit from doesn't make any sense, and we would certainly argue against Tasmanians paying roughly half the share of Marinus Link,"" Mr White said. ""The fact is that it's the Australian market that needs our clean, reliable and dispatchable energy, and therefore they should fund Marinus Link."" In their letters to the former prime minister, former Tasmanian premiers Will Hodgman and Peter Gutwein said getting a fair price deal for Tasmanian power users was a ""threshold issue"" for the state government. ""The state has been very clear since the outset that we cannot proceed with the project without achieving a fair cost allocation, and as you would be aware, the current regulatory arrangements do not allow for the costs of project Marinus to be fairly allocated among customers,"" Mr Gutwein wrote in December 2021. They wanted the Commonwealth government to support an application to the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) to change the rules so that Tasmanians wouldn't bear 50 per cent of the cost of Marinus Link. But later that month Mr Morrison warned it probably wouldn't be possible to change that rule in time for Marinus Link's proposed Final Investment Decision date. ""I am advised reform of the current transmission investment framework, either through the ENCRC or through an AEMC rule change, is unlikely to present a viable way forward in time for a final investment decision to be taken on the project in 2024,"" Mr Morrison wrote. He suggested that Tasmanian consumers would have to pay based on the current rules, but that would be made up for by Hydro Tasmania and other generators getting higher revenues. Mr Morrison also said that the Commonwealth would pay to build Marinus Link if private investors didn't want to. The then-prime minister and then-premier Gutwein agreed that the Commonwealth would support Tasmania's application to AEMO for a cost recovery rule change. The correspondence between the federal and state leaders was obtained by the Tasmanian Labor Party through Right to Information. Labor's Energy spokesman Dean Winter questioned Tasmania's Energy Minister Guy Barnett about it during a budget estimates hearing earlier this month. On Tuesday, Mr Barnett said the Tasmanian government was working with the Commonwealth and AEMC to make its application for a rule change. He said he was confident a rule change could be made in time for the Final Investment Decision for Marinus Link in 2024. ""Written into the Memorandum of Understanding and funding agreement for Marinus Link and Battery of the Nation, is a commitment from both the Tasmanian and Australian Governments to work together to submit a cost allocation rule change to the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) for Marinus Link,"" Mr Barnett said. ""This agreement was signed on the 3rd of April 2022."" ""This is an important step to ensure interconnector pricing and cost allocation to those jurisdictions that would benefit from Marinus and access Tasmania's low-cost renewable generation, and I expect the rule change application to be lodged shortly."" Consultant Marc White was less confident a rule change could be secured before 2024. He said it would usually take one to two years to get AEMC to agree to and carry out a rule change. ""This (rule change application) appears to be a very complex one because it may have unintended consequences for other interconnectors either now or in the future, and so it looks to me like this is such a complex issue that it doesn't appear that it's going to be likely to happen before Marinus is planned to progress,"" he said. Mr White was concerned by the prospect that the Tasmanian and Commonwealth Governments might green-light Marinus Link even if a rule change, protecting Tasmanian consumers from bearing an unfair proportion of costs, wasn't yet in place. ""It's looking like the Marinus train has a fair head of steam up, despite any cost recovery obstacles, this train looks like it's going to be kept pushed down the track."" Labor's Dean Winter said his party would support Marinus Link if it's in the best interests of Tasmania, but said Labor did not have the information needed. If it [Marinus Link] can't get its rule change by Final Investment Decision date, I'm not sure how it's going to be able to make a decision,"" he said. ""We can't be in a situation where Tasmanians have to pay over and above the benefits they get, that's obviously not fair."" Marinus Link is projected to inject $2.9 billion into the Tasmanian and Victorian economies, and create 2,800 jobs while the infrastructure is being built. Independent Murchison MLC Ruth Forrest has reservations about the project. She said Tasmanians had very little information about how they will benefit from Marinus Link. ""We know that there'll be more benefit in terms of the energy supply to the mainland,"" Ms Forrest said. ""Ongoing employment will be very limited in terms of even during but particularly after the build, should it proceed. There are so many unknowns the require clear answers before we really do commit to such a major project.""'

51,Chinese investment in Australia plunged to 'literally none'. Has China already bought what it wanted?,business,"  Chinese investors fast abandoning Australia but still hold vast amounts of infrastructure, land and water Chinese investors are fast abandoning Australia as a frosty bilateral relationship dampens trade, with a report showing Chinese investment in Australia nosedived by almost 70 per cent last year to the lowest level since 2007. A report by KPMG and The University of Sydney found Chinese firms laid out $778 million in Australia in 2021, compared to $2.5 billion in 2020. At its peak in 2008, when Beijing desperately needed natural resources to boost the economy, investors from China splurged about $US16.2 billion  ($19.1bn based on 2008 exchange rate) in Australia, which was 24 times more than last year. The number of deals last year almost halved to 11, from 20 in 2020. Four transactions — related to acquiring iron ore and lithium mines — accounted for most of the total Chinese investment inflows last year. Since 2017, Chinese investment in Australia has been plummeting, but last year's results have shocked experts who have been monitoring the trend. ""The decline really has now gone to a level where there is literally none or very little investment coming from China,"" Hans Hendrischke, report co-author and professor in Chinese business and management from the University of Sydney, told ABC News. ""We are surprised in a sense that it's dropping so fast."" While there has been a diplomatic breakthrough and a significant shift in tone towards China from the new government, experts say it might take some time for Chinese investors to return. In recent years, Chinese investors have been facing the double whammy of a domestic clampdown on capital export and stricter screening from Australian regulators. In 2016, Beijing started to impose restrictions on capital outflows due to concerns over excessive debt, inappropriate investment and capital flight. At the same time, Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board's (FIRB) tougher application process subdued interest from potential Chinese buyers. Professor Hendrischke said the current geopolitical climate was another obstacle. ""US, very strongly, and Europe, [including] the UK, Germany and France, are screening Chinese investment now for any potential conflicts that they could have with Chinese controls over certain assets [and] Australia is part of that,"" he said. ""The relationship between Australia and China is not a very good one at the moment and diplomatic contacts are interrupted. That does not allow us to go ahead or even approve more investment."" An example is Chinese-owned tech giant Huawei. The Turnbull government banned it from taking part in the rollout of 5G mobile infrastructure due to national security concerns. Despite the highly politicised atmosphere, Wei Li, a lecturer in international business at the University of Sydney, said Chinese investors were holding on to their Australian assets. ""I don't see a major trend of Chinese companies withdrawing their investment in Australia yet,"" Dr Li said. ""The main sentiment is to wait and see. For a lot of Chinese companies, Australia is their first overseas country that they have ever invested [in]. There's a lot of commitment."" Traditionally, Chinese firms view Australia as a ""test market"". They get a ""Western experience"" by investing in Australia and then expand to other similar economies. Analysts argue the huge loss of foreign funding from China means Australian companies may miss out on future opportunities, including access to the Chinese domestic market. Between 2007 and 2021, China's state-owned enterprises and private companies poured a total of $158 billion into Australia, including by investing or acquiring mining and energy companies, infrastructure, wind turbine farms and a dairy processor. Last year, Suzhou CATH Energy-Technologies invested $318 million in lithium explorer AVZ Minerals and Clive Palmer's Balmoral Iron was bought by CITIC for $187 million, according to the report. In 2017, Chinese mining group Yancoal acquired Rio Tinto coal assets Coal & Allied, including the Hunter Valley's Mount Thorley and Warkworth sites. Two of Australia's biggest energy companies were acquired by Chinese firms in the past decade. Energy Australia was sold to China Light and Power Company by the NSW government in 2011, while the sale of Alinta Energy to Chinese company Chow Tai Fook was approved by then-treasurer Scott Morrison in 2017. In terms of infrastructure, Chinese company Landbridge Group secured a 99-year lease of Darwin Port for over $500 million in 2015, and a Chinese-backed consortium successfully bid $1.75 billion for a 98-year lease of the world's biggest coal port, the Port of Newcastle, in 2014. The controversial lease Darwin Port remains in the spotlight amid China’s new security pact with Solomon Islands. So, how and why did it happen? However, both deals drew criticism from politicians and national security experts. According to 2021 government reports on foreign ownership of agricultural land and water, Chinese companies were also big stakeholders in those areas. Currently, 14.1 per cent of Australia's agricultural land is foreign owned, and China is the largest foreign owner (2.3 per cent). China is also the third-largest stakeholder of Australian water behind Canada and the US, owning 604 gigalitres or 1.5 per cent of the total Australian water entitlement. About 11 per cent of the Australian water is foreign owned. Under the ""going out"" strategy, initiated by the Chinese government at the turn of this century, Chinese firms were encouraged to invest aboard. The aim was to secure natural resources and intellectual property to support the growth of the economy. ""Over the last decade or so, China has really become one of the world's largest foreign investors,"" according to Gerard Burg, senior economist at National Australia Bank. ""This was a conscious decision. Initially, it was very heavily resource intensive. A lot of investment in countries like Australia was seeking access to things like iron ore and coal. ""But more recently, it has moved away from those sort of investment targets, more towards things like technology."" Professor Hendrischke agreed, saying that after the mining boom, when state-led Chinese firms acquired enough assets, they shifted towards health care, agribusiness and renewable energy. But more recently, as the geopolitical competition between China and the US flared, investment interest in Australia shifted from bigger acquisitions to safe assets. About one-third of total investment over the past two years was held in commercial real estate. ""There is a degree of insecurity and uncertainty,"" Professor Hendrischke said. ""How the relationship between the US and China plays out over the long term will have an impact on Australia."" The report also found Chinese companies were flocking to Europe and countries associated with the Belt and Road Initiative. Last year, Chinese investment in Europe grew by one-quarter. ""Just as we've been debating how to diversify away from China here in Australia, China has already started diversifying away from Australia in this regard,"" Pichamon Yeophantong, a senior lecturer at UNSW Canberra, said. Despite the pandemic, China has continued to invest abroad at a steady pace. According to China's Ministry of Commerce, outbound direct investment from China rose by 9.2 per cent to $208 billion. In 2020, while investment globally was falling, China's government claimed to be the world's largest investor, with total spending of $220.5 billion. Economists have noticed big discrepancies between official and unofficial measures, such as the American Enterprise Institute’s China Global Investment Tracker. ""There is some uncertainty around the accuracy of this data,"" Mr Burg said. ""The key destinations for China's private investment, according to that official data, have been Hong Kong, as well as two notable tax havens, the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands. ""One possibility is that the investors are trying to mask the origin of investment funds. By going through the tax havens, they can wash away the concerns in other countries about Chinese investment. ""Or it's the possibility that Chinese firms and high-net-worth individuals maybe try to get their capital out of China. That would be a major negative for China's long-term growth prospects, particularly concerns around its financial sector."" President Xi Jinping's ""common prosperity"" policies have sparked fears of wealth redistribution in recent years, especially in the tech and financial sectors. Mr Burg noted that Australian data showed the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands were the sources of the ninth-largest and 20th-largest stock of foreign direct investment in 2020, while Hong Kong ranked 11th overall. China's official data also shows Chinese investment in countries affiliated with the Belt and Road Initiative increased by 14 per cent to $28.6 billion last year. The initiative aims to connect more than 65 countries across various continents for trade, with a particular focus on infrastructure-starved developing nations. It has also been widely viewed as a tool for Beijing to exercise soft power. But the lack of transparency in Chinese loans terms and the alarming debt levels among poor nations have sparked speculation about ""debt-trap diplomacy"". The theory is when a country defaults or keeps borrowing more to repay its loans, Beijing will have some leverage in demanding concessions or other advantages in exchange for debt relief. ""China's share of outstanding external debt to emerging market countries has increased sharply over the past decade,"" Carmen Altenkirch, from asset management company Aviva Investors, said. ""This reflected a desire on the part of some emerging market governments to access capital for infrastructure investment, and a willingness on the part of Chinese entities to lend. ""China is one of the largest creditors to emerging market countries at a time when debt is, or is quickly becoming, unsustainable for many."" The trade war between Beijing and Canberra is hurting both sides greatly, but will the change of Australian government bring it to an end? However, Ms Altenkirch said there was no evidence Chinese authorities had actively tried to put certain countries into too much debt. China's former central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, rejected suggestions his country was using debt-trap diplomacy, saying debtor countries demanded Chinese lending and it provided long-term economic benefits. ""There is a certain degree of difficulty in this process, and it must be carefully considered and designed to find a way to alleviate the debt problems of the countries along the Belt and Road, while avoiding suggestions that there are bad motives,"" he said at an economic forum in April.

52,Activists say a WA 'carbon bomb' will damage Queensland's Great Barrier Reef,business,"  Conservation group seeks injunction to stop Woodside gas project to protect Great Barrier Reef It is 3,000 kilometres from the Great Barrier Reef, but according to a Federal Court challenge mounted by conservationists, a gas project in Western Australia could have disastrous impacts on Queensland's embattled World Heritage site. The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) has applied for an injunction against Woodside's Scarborough gas project, asking that it be halted until new federal Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek has assessed whether the operation will damage the Great Barrier Reef by exacerbating climate change. ACF boss Kelly O’Shanassy said the west coast project posed a major risk to Australia's precious World Heritage site. ""People in Australia would be shocked to know that the Scarborough gas mine that is proposed has never been approved under Australia's environmental law or assessed for the impact that [it] will have on places like the Great Barrier Reef,"" Ms O’Shanassy said. ""It's a really, really big carbon bomb."" ""It's like turning on 15 coal-fired power stations across Australia."" Woodside said gas produced by the project would generate enough electricity to power 10 times the number of homes in Perth, and it would do that with emissions of about half of what would be generated by coal. In a statement, Woodside CEO Meg O'Neill said: “The Scarborough Project has been the subject of rigorous environmental assessments by a range of regulators. ""The project will deliver significant local and national benefits in the form of employment, tax revenue and reliable gas supply in the energy transition for decades to come. “Woodside will vigorously defend its position in these proceedings."" According to the documents filed to the court, predicted emissions from the project would cause global temperatures to rise by nearly 0.0004 degrees Celsius, ""which will result in the deaths of millions of corals during each future mass bleaching event"". ACF also argued that additional warming presented ""a real risk"" that could in turn trigger a spiral of further, runaway warming, which would all but destroy the Great Barrier Reef. Any increased warming would result in additional death of coral on the Great Barrier Reef, Selina Ward, a coral reef scientist at the University of Queensland, said. ""Already at this stage, we are losing vast numbers of corals in bleaching events that are becoming more frequent,"" Dr Ward said. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg from the University of Queensland agreed. ""We're at a point now where every bit of carbon going into the atmosphere has a price and that price is growing by the day,"" Professor Hoegh-Guldberg said. This year, the Great Barrier Reef experienced its sixth mass-bleaching event — a phenomenon driven by global warming, which was never observed prior to 1998. Scientific arguments similar to those used by ACF were presented to the Federal Court by a group of young people trying to establish a duty of care on the environment minister to protect them from climate change. At the time, then-environment minister Sussan Ley accepted the scientific arguments, instead disputing the legal implications of them — an argument she won on appeal. There were all the signs that 2022 was going to be the climate election — and this year's election results speak for themselves, writes Michael Slezak. A spokeswoman for Ms Plibersek said she was unable to comment on the legal challenge to Woodside's Scarborough gas project because the case was before court. But new Resources Minister Madeleine King has backed the project, and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said the government will support fossil fuel projects that ""stack up environmentally and then commercially"". Woodside plans to open up the new Scarborough gas field, lay about 430km of gas pipes on the sea floor, and significantly expand existing liquefaction facilities, known as ""Pluto"", near Karratha in Western Australia. The project has received key environmental approvals from state and federal governments, and last year Woodside announced a final investment decision had been made to progress the project. The federal environmental assessment was conducted by the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA), rather than the environment minister, under devolved powers given to the agency. All offshore projects would normally undergo assessment by NOPSEMA. However, projects likely to have a significant impact on the Great Barrier Reef cannot be assessed solely by NOPSEMA, and are required to undergo a full assessment by the environment minister. As a result, the Environmental Defenders Office, on behalf of ACF, argued that if the project proceeded, it would do so without the required approvals. According to Woodside, the project will create up to 3,200 jobs during construction and ""nearly"" 600 ongoing jobs. But Bill Hare, a scientist from consultancy Climate Analytics, said emissions figures claimed by the company ignored emissions from the existing LNG facilities at the site. He said the emissions would actually be about 40 per cent higher — nearly 1.4 billion tonnes. ""Its lifetime emissions would be equivalent to about three times Australia's present national emissions,"" he said. Most of those emissions would occur when the gas was burned — much of which would occur overseas. But according to Mr Hare, the project would contribute 41 million tonnes to Australia's domestic emissions by 2030. He said that was about 7 per cent of our 2005 emissions — the baseline Australia has now committed to cut emissions to 43 per cent below. Woodside has said its estimate of 878 million tonnes of emissions is a figure that has been accepted by Australian regulators.

53,"Mining industry slams Queensland royalties increase as 'short-sighted', but others believe it makes hay while the sun's shining",business,"  Coal royalty increase in Queensland state budget blasted by mining industry, resources council Mining industry bodies have criticised the Queensland government's decision to hike coal royalty rates, labelling the move as ""short-sighted"" and ""misguided"". Treasurer Cameron Dick announced what he labelled a progressive new royalty scheme in the state budget on Tuesday. But Minerals Council of Australia chief executive officer Tania Constable said she believed the move could place jobs at risk. ""This tax grab is short-sighted and counterproductive over the long term and has the potential to scare off investors in all commodities,"" she said. The new scheme would see three new tiers added to the royalty system, which is currently capped at 15 per cent for prices above $150 per tonne. From next month, new tiers would apply of 20 per cent for prices above $175 per tonne, 30 per cent for prices above $225 per tonne, and 40 per cent for prices above $300 per tonne. Mr Dick said each new tier applied only on the margin, meaning if the coal price was $302 per tonne, the 40 per cent rate would only apply to that last $2. ""With coal recently trading at over AUD$500 per tonne, our current rate structure is clearly no longer fit for purpose,"" he said. ""We know the foreign shareholders of coal companies won't like these changes, but they can rest easy. ""We are not increasing the rates that apply at the existing tiers."" He said the new regime was forecast to deliver an additional $1.2 billion in royalties over the forward estimates. ""All of that $1.2 billion, and more, will be going into regional Queensland,"" Mr Dick said. Handing down his third budget, Treasurer Cameron Dick reveals Queensland will deliver a net operating surplus at the end of this month, thanks to surging coal and oil prices and a booming housing market. But Queensland Resources Council chief executive Ian Macfarlane said the policy was ""misguided"" and would make the state less internationally competitive. ""What the government also isn't telling people is that because of the GST equalisation process, 80 per cent of the extra royalties raised will be redirected to Canberra over the next five years anyway,"" he said. ""So the net economic benefit for Queensland will be minimal but the potential damage to our industry, and the Queensland economy, could be major."" He said the resources sector contributed a record $84.3 billion to the state's economy last financial year, including through spending, and supported more than 422,000 jobs. Anglo American operate several mines across central Queensland, including the Moranbah North and Grosvenor mines. The company's Australian CEO Nick Barlow said the changes meant it would now contribute 60 per cent of its profits to governments through state and federal taxes. ""Queensland's coal royalty rates were already among the highest in the world,"" he said. ""This new tax is inconceivable, and it will place a heavy burden on our sector and Queensland mining regions."" He said the new tiers would hurt business cases for any new investment. ""Significant capital investment is required to sustain mining operations, including in constructing and preparing mining areas, mining equipment and infrastructure,"" Mr Barlow said. ""In a highly cyclical business, we need higher price periods to make these investments, which not only create jobs and support our regions, but also benefits the Queensland economy. Professor John Quiggin from the University of Queensland's School of Economics said the government's policy was a ""good way of capitalising on current high coal prices, which are unlikely to be sustained"". ""Raising these rates is not going to lead anyone to close down,"" he said. ""If the price is $300 a tonne, paying $120 in royalties isn't going to put you out of business. ""You won't see these [high] prices indefinitely. ""We've got the chance to get the money now out of these resources. It won't come again."" Professor Quiggin said he believed, regardless of the new tiers, there was not going to be significant new investment in coal. ""That's one of the reasons why prices have gone so high, because no one is willing to invest a lot in getting access to new coal resources,"" he said. ""What we have is an asset, which is worth a fair bit now but will be valueless in the future."" Kylie Porter from the Greater Whitsunday Alliance, the economic development agency for the Mackay, Isaac and Whitsunday regions, said the government's move could impact coal sales. ""We have to be realistic about the fact that buyers of our region's coal may start to look at other markets because the price will be up there, and very expensive,"" she said. She said Queensland coal was some of the ""most efficient"" and this move could ""force buyers away from our market and to use a lower quality coal"". ""They are conversations that we need to actually have and find some balance in the argument around it,"" Ms Porter said. ""What we actually need to make sure is that our regions, through the current buoyant coal pricing period, are supported while we start to look for new replacement sectors that can help support our community transform for the future."" Anne Baker is Mayor at the Isaac Regional Council, an area that takes up a large proportion of the Bowen Basin and is home to many coal mines. ""What we know, in the Isaac region, is that our region contributed 53 per cent of Queensland's coal royalties and we're the largest resource region in the state,"" Cr Baker said. ""So what we are wanting to see is an appropriate reinvestment of the royalties back into our region, funding that supports health, education, childcare, aged care, affordable housing. ""That's our role to advocate and to work towards, to bring that attention to the conversation."" The budget also included funding for projects like a new hospital for Moranbah, something Cr Baker welcomed. ""We make a high contribution to the economy of this state, and it is only fair and only reasonable that there is an equitable return to the regions that deliver that economic positive,"" she said. Central Highlands Development Corporation CEO Peter Dowling said he was still digesting what it meant for the local industry, but he hoped to see further investment. He said the region ""punched well above its weight"" in terms of economic output. ""The challenge we face in inland regions like the Central Highlands is the investment into our regions for all of those essential living requirements that we have,"" Mr Dowling said.

54,Unprecedented intervention in energy market could be ended within days,business,"  Australian Energy Market Operator signals it will likely end its market intervention this week The unprecedented suspension of Australia's east coast energy market could be lifted as early as Thursday but the market operator is warning the challenges managing supply and demand may continue. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) last week seized control of the east coast energy market for the first time in its history after days of volatility put several states at risk of blackouts. The federal government backed the intervention, acknowledging the energy market had effectively failed, and credited the AEMO with successfully managing to avoid both blackouts and load shedding as temperatures on the east coast plummeted. But after a meeting with the energy sector on Tuesday, guidelines have been drawn up for a ""staged process"" to resume regular operations, with the AEMO suggesting the suspension could be lifted as early as Thursday. After a mere two weeks to assess the state of the National Electricity Market, Chris Bowen has found it crumbling in his hands, writes Melissa Clarke. ""These criteria will … give AEMO sufficient confidence that it can end the market suspension with minimal risk of the same conditions re-emerging in the very short term,"" AEMO said in a statement. ""AEMO anticipates monitoring will continue for at least 24 hours and, if AEMO is confident the criteria are being met, the next step is to formally remove the market suspension and resume normal operation under the market rules."" The market operator has confirmed there is sufficient supply to get through Wednesday but has revealed it is still directing generators to pump power into the network. ""Conditions remain dynamic, requiring AEMO to manually direct generators to be available to meet consumers' energy needs,"" it said in a statement. And it has warned, regardless of when the suspension is lifted: ""There may continue to be challenges managing supply and demand."" The crisis has been caused, in part, by soaring global coal and gas prices and an ageing fleet of coal-fired power stations in Australia operating below capacity.

55,Britain's biggest rail strike in 30 years over pay and jobs brings network to a standstill,business,"  Britain's biggest rail strike in 30 years has kicked off as tens of thousands of staff walked out in a dispute over pay and jobs that could pave the way for widespread industrial action across the economy in the coming months. Picket lines appeared at dawn and will be lined by some of the more than 40,000 rail workers who are due to strike on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, bringing the network to a standstill. The London Underground was also shut due to the strike. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, under pressure to do more to help British households who face the toughest economic hit in decades, said the industrial action would harm businesses as they continue to recover from the pandemic. Unions have said the rail strikes could mark the start of a ""summer of discontent"" with teachers, medics, waste disposal workers and even barristers moving towards industrial action as surging food and fuel prices pushes inflation towards 10 per cent. ""Our campaign will run for as long as it needs to run,"" Mick Lynch, secretary-general of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT), told reporters on Monday. The prime minister said the unions were harming the people they claimed to be helping. ""By going ahead with these rail strikes, they are driving away commuters who ultimately support the jobs of rail workers, whilst also impacting businesses and communities across the country,"" Mr Johnson will tell his cabinet later on Tuesday, according to his office. Britain's economy initially rebounded strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic but a combination of labour shortages, supply chain disruption, inflation and post-Brexit trade problems has prompted warnings of a recession. The government says it is giving extra support to millions of the poorest households but says above-inflation pay rises would damage the fundamentals of the economy. ""Sustained higher levels of inflation would have a far bigger impact on people's pay packets in the long run, destroying savings and extending the difficulties we're facing for longer,"" Mr Johnson said. The outbreak of industrial action has drawn comparison with the 1970s, when Britain faced widespread labour strikes including the 1978-79 ""winter of discontent"". The strikes come as travellers at British airports experience chaotic delays and last-minute cancellations due to staff shortages while many Britons have to wait months for new passports to arrive due to processing delays. The rail strike means only about half of Britain's rail network will be open on strike days with a very limited service running on those lines and continued disruption on the days in between strike days.

56,Renewable energy retailer Enova goes into administration,business,"  Green energy electricity retailer Enova enters voluntary administration Australia's first community owned energy retailer, Enova, has been placed in voluntary administration. In an email sent to customers, the company said the energy crisis affecting Australia's east coast had an ""unbearable"" effect on the company's ability to operate. The company focuses on providing energy from renewable sources. About half of its energy supply is purchased from its customers' rooftop solar, while the other half is typically provided by Victorian-based retailer Diamond Energy. But Enova said it had not been able to secure a new fixed pricing arrangement after its agreement with Diamond Energy came to an end. Enova said that would have meant the business became ""fully exposed to severely inflated wholesale energy prices"" from July 1. When combined with a cap on customer pricing, Enova said it was no longer financially viable. Chief executive Felicity Stening said in a statement that the market was ""broken"" and did not support small retailers. ""The current diabolical state of the energy market, combined with the high wholesale market energy prices and the cap on customer pricing, has made it impossible for Enova Energy and many other small retailers to operate,"" she said. ""In addition, the constant raft of state and federal government regulatory changes is adding to the market complexities and have caused Enova delays in being able to fund and resource energy innovation."" The National Electricity Market is in dire need of repair. How long will it take to fix? asks Gareth Hutchens. Enova advised that its entire team was made redundant as part of the administration process. Most staff are based in the New South Wales Northern Rivers region, where the company was started. Cathro & Partners has been appointed to oversee the administration process. The energy crisis and rising gas prices have had flow-on effects for manufacturers as well. Major employers and lobby groups are warning the high prices could be force them to shut or move offshore. A brick manufacturer announced it would shut its doors last week, citing high energy prices. Customers have been advised that their electricity will not be disconnected. Cathro & Partners said the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) had the power to appoint new retailers for customers under the Retailer of Last Resort scheme. Customers will be transferred automatically to a new retailer. Any bills issued by Enova before the transfer need to be paid. After the transfer, Enova customers can expect to be contacted by their new retailer to arrange payment arrangements moving forward. Enova said customers who did not wish to transfer to the retailer identified by the AER had the right to change their provider without penalty. Enova opened its doors in Byron Bay in 2016 after raising $3.8 million from 1,090 investors. It was first set up as a social enterprise, with a focus on supplying renewable energy. Its founders were inspired by the anti-coal seam gas movement — in particular a blockade in 2014 that helped prevent gas exploration at a site in nearby Bentley. Enova services 13,200 customers across NSW and South East Queensland. This year Enova was awarded a five-star rating by Greenpeace in its Green Energy Guide for providing clean energy and avoiding pollution and environmental harm. Both Enova Community Energy and retail arm Enova Energy have entered administration. Not-for-profit arm Enova Community will remain in operation.

57,Federal Court rules in favour of international workers in wage dispute,business,"  Federal Court rules in favour of international workers in wage dispute The Federal Court has ruled a New South Wales restaurateur significantly underpaid two international workers in a major contravention of the Fair Work Act. Indian national Midhun Basi and Pakistani national Syed Haider sued Vaisakh Usha and his company, Namitha Nakul Pty Ltd, claiming breaches of the Act. The men, both 35, claimed they were owed more than $200,000 in unpaid wages while working as chefs at Mr Usha's Adythia Kerala restaurants in Wollongong and Nowra between 2016 and 2018. In handing down his preliminary judgement on Tuesday, Justice John Halley ruled in favour of the employees. ""I have found that there were multiple contraventions concerning the underpayment of both applicants over a period of some two years,"" Justice Halley said. ""Mr Usha denied their complaints repeatedly, sought to have Mr Haider provide backdated time sheets and make a statement containing incorrect representations and made fallacious claims about loans to attempt to cover up and avoid the consequences of the contraventions. ""Further, the respondents failed to keep records relating to the conduct that gave rise to the contraventions. ""There should be judgement for each of Mr Basi and Mr Haider against the respondents for the full amount of the underpayment under the Award of their wages plus tax."" During the proceedings, Mr Basi gave evidence that he was forced to work about 70 hours a week, often without a break. Justice Halley rejected the claim, in part due to a lack of accurate employment records provided by both parties. ""The applicants did not work 12-hour days for six days a week for Namitha Nakul,"" he said. ""It was not possible to conclude on the balance of probabilities that the applicants had worked overtime hours or had worked for more than five hours on any given day without a break."" Mr Basi also told the court he was paid $1,711 a fortnight but was asked to pay back $511 to Mr Usha to cover the cost of his 457 visa. Mr Usha told the court that the money he requested from Mr Basi was to repay loans to him, but Justice Halley did not accept the claim. He said the demand for the money amounted to ""a serious contravention"" of the Fair Work Act upon which Mr Usha was ""knowingly involved"". During the hearing, the men gave evidence that their employment and visa sponsorship was threatened on multiple occasions, if they did not comply with Mr Usha's demands. ""I am satisfied that statements were made by Mr Usha to Mr Basi that he would ""lose his job"" or ""lose everything"", and that they were threats of dismissal,"" Justice Halley said. ""[The statements] were designed to make Mr Basi compliant with the work arrangements Mr Usha had instituted, which involved him foregoing his ""workplace rights"", namely his award entitlements. ""I am also satisfied that the statements also involved the application of undue influence or undue pressure on Mr Basi for him to accept Mr Usha effectively deducting monies from his salary,"" he said. In making his judgement, Justice Halley said he had taken into consideration the difficulty of conducting the proceedings via Microsoft Teams, and with the assistance of an interpreter. Principal of WorkLawyers, Kristian Bolwell, who ran the men's legal case pro-bono with barrister Lisa Doust, said he was pleased with the outcome. ""The Court has found Mr Usha ripped off our clients Mr Basi and Mr Haider, and did so on an epic and systematic basis,"" Mr Bolwell said. ""This employer will shortly have to go to court again to argue why they shouldn't have to pay maximum penalties of $126,000 for Mr Usha and $630,000 for his company [Namitha Nakul]."" Defence solicitor Brian Gillard said he was taking the time to consider the lengthy, 93-page judgement in detail. ""The Court will now consider the form of Orders proposed by the parties and it is not appropriate to comment further until the Court has finished its work,"" Mr Gillard said. The matter will return to court in July to consider compensation calculations, penalties, and costs before a final judgement will be delivered.

58,Geraldton bears brunt of cancelled Qantas flights,business,"  Qantas Perth to Geraldton flights cut in move expected to affect Midwest businesses Qantas' decision to target the Geraldton to Perth flight route for cutbacks has been criticised by the Midwest Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The airline announced last week it would cut a number of flights in regional WA over the next month to manage the impact of COVID-19 on staffing levels and reduce the number of last-minute cancellations. Fifteen of those flights are between Geraldton and Perth. A Qantas spokeswoman said a figure of 19 planned cancellations was incorrect but did not respond to a request for the total number of planned cancellations in regional WA. Midwest Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Joanne Fabling said Geraldton was shouldering much of the burden from the decision. ""Geraldton unfortunately being a 45-50-minute flight is probably not the most profitable of Qantas' flights,"" she said. ""That's where our concerns are because the loyalty that Qantas has in the regions is strong and we'd like to continue that. ""We would ask [for] a fairer loading across the regional networks when they're cancelling flights."" Ms Fabling said the reduced schedule would affect local traders and that the bulk of local air travel was for business. ""A lot of our flights because they leave Perth early in the morning are good for Perth people to come up and do business in Geraldton,"" she said. ""For Geraldton businesses, a lot of them will travel in the afternoon and come back the next day. She said there was a lot of business travel, fly-in, fly-out travel and leisure travel. However, she said she was aware the airline had more impacts from the pandemic than current isolation requirements. ""They were running a fairly lean staffing as they powered up to come back online to 100 per cent staff for flights in the regions,"" she said. ""We also need to be mindful that this airline was grounded for a long time ... they're bringing on a new workforce. ""At the end of the day, we want to fly safely."" Want more local news? Sign up for the weekly ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt email newsletter A Qantas spokeswoman said the company was doing the pre-emptive cancellations to help manage ongoing COVID-related absences.

59,"Qantas changes mask rules, saying airports 'higher risk' for COVID-19 than planes",business,"  Qantas axes mask requirement on some outbound international flights Qantas no longer requires passengers to wear masks on some of its international flights and has moved to clarify the complicated rules currently governing their use onboard. The airline last week flagged it would be updating its onboard mask policy for international flights to align with the rules at the destination. It means masks are no longer required on board flights from New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland to the United Kingdom, United States and Rome. However, as Australian rules require plane passengers to wear masks, they remain mandatory on inbound flights. Masks also remain mandatory on all domestic Australian flights, but the mandate has been scrapped at West Australian airports. The move was in line with other Australian states and territories after the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) recommended they be dropped in almost all indoor settings. In a statement last week, Qantas said they were continuing to push for uniform rules. ""Given the different rules in different jurisdictions overseas as well as for domestic flights in Australia and now at airports, we appreciate some of our customers may find mask requirements confusing, particularly when they have connecting flights,"" the statement said. ""We're doing our best to help them prepare for their flights as well as continuing to talk to governments about the need for more consistent rules."" Chief executive Alan Joyce told Nine Radio there was a ""good case"" to remove masks from aircraft ""to stop this confusion"". Mr Joyce said planes had ""the safest environment of any transport in the world"". ""You've got the HEPA filters on an aircraft that take out 99 per cent of all particles, including COVID-19,"" he said. ""You've got the air that circulates every six minutes, you've got everybody facing in a forward direction. ""Boeing have done a study that showed if you're sitting next to somebody that coughs, it's equivalent to be in seven-foot away from them on the ground."" ANU infectious diseases expert Dr Sanjaya Senanayake said the risk of getting infections on planes was quite low due to the filtration systems, people facing the same way and the upright seat backs providing a limited barrier. ""When you look at outbreaks on planes in general, when it does happen it tends to be people in the immediate surroundings of someone who’s got an infection, so maybe in the first couple of rows in front and behind,"" Dr Senanayake said. But he said there were still hospital admissions for COVID lung disease every day, and he urged anyone who was at high risk of getting severe COVID such as older people and people with low immune systems, to continue to wear masks — particularly N95 masks. ""It is worth remembering that just because mask mandates have been removed, health departments around the country aren't saying 'that’s it for masks', they're not saying that at all,"" Dr Senanayake said. ""They are still recommending that people should wear masks if they can’t safely physically distance."" Australian Medical Association national president Omar Khorshid agreed that aeroplanes were low-risk. ""The air in aeroplanes changes over pretty quickly and goes through HEPA filters which remove 99.9 per cent of particles,"" Dr Khorshid said. ""The air is also very dry and cold, as we would all recognise on aeroplanes, and all those things go against the transmission of viruses. ""In fact perhaps the airports are higher-risk places."" Dr Khorshid said it would only be a matter of time before the mandate on other air travel in Australia was removed. “The AMA is not opposed to the removal of mask mandates where those decisions are made on correct science and on public health grounds. ""We certainly welcome any steps Australia can take safely to get us back to a more normal life."" But he said those who felt vulnerable should keep masks on for an extra layer of protection. Qantas will continue to offer masks to customers on flights who wish to wear them.

60,Cattle boss calls it quits in sudden resignation,business," ABC Rural AACo CEO Hugh Killen resigns from Australia's largest cattle company Australian Agricultural Company chief executive Hugh Killen has resigned after more than four years in the top job. His resignation is effective immediately. A statement from the company to the Australian Stock Exchange said it was the right time to begin an orderly executive leadership transition. ""The board and I would like to take the opportunity to thank Hugh for his significant contribution to the business and recognise the progress that has been achieved under his leadership,"" the statement reads. ""Hugh has steered AACo through some of the worst droughts and floods Australia has ever seen, the global impacts of COVID-19 and market fluctuations which occurred as a result of market impacts."" AACo posted an operating profit of $49.9 million last month, with the value of its herd increasing to nearly $200 million. The company's herd has increased to about 382,000 head and its property portfolio was valued at $254 million in May. Chief operating officer Dave Harris will take up the role of acting chief executive. ""The board will now conduct and executive search process that will include internal and external candidates in the domestic and international market,"" the statement reads. It comes after mining magnate Andrew Forrest's investment company Tattarang last week made a significant increase in its shareholding in AACo. Tattarang started buying into AACo last year, and late last week purchased another $122 million in shares, bringing its holdings to 17 per cent. The investment is just below the 20 per cent threshold whereby a takeover bid must be made. The latest share purchase likely came from Heytesbury Cattle Company's 7.5 per cent stake in AACo, according to the Australian Financial Review. Tattarang declined to comment on the AACo investment.

61,NSW budget deficit more than triples to $11.3 billion,business,"  NSW budget deficit more than triples to $11.3 billion The state's forecasted budget deficit has more than tripled, as the NSW government seeks to embark on major economic reforms while grappling with COVID-19 and disaster spending. Dominic Perrottet's government has handed down its first budget, as he and Treasurer Matt Kean look to make their mark on both the economy and voters nine months ahead of an election. The deficit has blown out to $11.3 billion, far exceeding the $3.6 billion deficit forecasted in the 2021-22 half-yearly review. Treasurer Matt Kean described the budget as a ""once in a generation reform budget for the people of NSW"". ""It invests in helping them reach their hopes and dreams for tomorrow, "" he said. ""We're betting on our kids, because we know investing in our kids and giving them a great education is what sets them up for a great life. ""[These are] investments that will deliver for families today that will also build a brighter, stronger prosperous tomorrow."" There's plenty of health spending and some big reforms for first home buyers — this is how NSW Treasurer Matt Kean's first budget will affect you. While the government seeks to reform home ownership and women's economic participation, it insists the blowout is largely driven by the hangover costs of COVID-19, health spending and the response to the floods. ""Since the half-year review, we've seen once-in-a-generation floods, "" Mr Kean said. ""We know that we're moving to a different stage of the pandemic and our health system is under enormous pressure ... we've also seen the impact of inflation on the state's financial position. ""We forecast that inflation will decrease in the future, but we need to support families now."" A modest return to budget surplus of $601 million in the 2024-25 financial year is forecast, driven by large increases in revenue from GST, mineral royalties, and other taxes. Net debt will balloon to $114.8 billion in the 2025-26 financial year, about 14 per cent of gross state product. While many of the key budget measures have been announced, the government revealed a $150 voucher for every primary and secondary student attending school in 2023. The $193 million budget item would help parents pay for shoes, bags, textbooks, stationery and school uniforms. It's part of $2.2 billion of additional spending to tackle the cost of living pressures, including $520 million in toll relief over the next two years. A key feature of the budget is spending to improve the participation rate of women in the workforce, with $775 million over the next four years for the creation of a fund to increase the supply of affordable childcare. In a bid to improve housing affordability, $2.8 billion is being spent on a shared equity trial and a scheme to allow some first home buyers to opt for an annual property tax instead. Over the next four years, $112.7 billion will be spent on infrastructure, including works to enable Parramatta Light Rail stage two by building the Wentworth Point Bridge and upgrades to the Wyong rail line to enable faster rail between Sydney, Newcastle, and the Central Coast. About $470 million of funding from the state's $5 billion WestInvest program will be spent to modernise nine schools in Western Sydney. Health will receive $4.5 billion in additional spending. For regional NSW, the Regional Growth Fund is being expanded by $1.3 billion. Programs designed in partnership with First Nations communities will receive money from a $716 million fund. NSW Opposition Leader Chris Minns today labelled the budget a ""spending spree"" that future generations will have to pay off. Mr Minns said the amount of debt would be an ongoing burden. ""Mr Kean spent $1 billion for every minute that he spoke at the lectern today,"" Mr Minns said. ""A huge amount of money in gross debt has been racked up by the New South Wales government ... that will we have to be paid off by future generations of taxpayers.""

62,Winners and losers in this years' NSW budget,business,"  NSW budget 2022: Here are the winners and losers NSW Treasurer Matt Kean has handed down his first budget. These are some of the biggest changes that could affect you. The budget includes big reforms for people looking to enter NSW's pricey property market. From January 16, 2023, many first home buyers will be able to elect to pay an annual land tax instead of stamp duty. The choice will be made available to first-time buyers purchasing a home up to the value of $1.5 million. If buyers decide to opt out of paying stamp duty, they will pay $400 plus 0.3 per cent of the land value per year. Meanwhile, a $780 million shared-equity scheme is set to help up to 3,000 frontline workers, single parents, and singles aged over 50 buy their first home. It would see the state contribute 40 per cent of equity for a new home, and 30 per cent for an existing home. The scheme is similar to the policy Labor leader Anthony Albanese took to last month's federal election. Premier Dominic Perrottet said NSW's plan would be trialled for two years. People will need to earn a maximum of $90,000 individually or have a combined income of $120,000 per year to be eligible. They will have to contribute a 2 per cent deposit under the scheme on homes worth up to $950,000 in metropolitan areas and $600,000 in regional areas. Home building is also getting a cash injection with nearly $500 million in funding to ""supercharge"" the approval of new housing. The planning project includes $300 million to co-fund shovel-ready infrastructure projects, $89 million to accelerate housing approvals, and $69.8 million to expedite rezoning. Palliative care services in some parts of NSW will be given a multi-million-dollar boost. The government will commit $743 million over five years to increase the number of beds and improve access to treatment and hire 600 new palliative health staffers. More than $90 million will be set aside to build new dedicated palliative care units at Westmead and Nepean hospitals. Mr Perrottet said the boost was the most important commitment in this year's budget. ""Whoever you are, wherever you are in our great state as you come to the end of your life you will have the care and support that you need and that is the sign of a true and just society,"" Mr Perrottet said. The government has locked in a $775 million commitment over the next four years to drive down childcare costs and increase the number of places. Under the plan, the state government will give subsidies to private childcare providers, to ensure some spots will be set at certain prices. Treasurer Matt Kean claims the changes will mean a middle-income Sydney family with one child in full-time child care in a state government-subsidised centre is expected to save up to $3,900 a year, while the saving in regional areas is predicted to be up to $7,800 a year. The paid parental leave scheme will also be overhauled to scrap the distinction between ""primary"" and ""secondary"" carers, in a bid to help women return to the workforce earlier. Instead, every mother and father in the public sector will be entitled to at least 14 weeks of paid parental leave. For mothers, there will be a grant to help them renter the workforce. The grants will give women up to $5,000, from a $32 million budget pool for clothes, training and technology. Meanwhile, young children in NSW will have an extra year of education under a new plan. Beginning in 2030, the plan will affect four- and five-year-olds and fall a year before what is known as kindergarten. The state government has committed to spending $5.8 billion over the next 10 years to make the blueprint a reality, and some of the money was set aside in the budget. Frontline health workers will get a one-off $3,000 ""thank-you"" payment for their work during the COVID-19 pandemic. The bonus is part of a $4.5 billion funding package for the health sector which also includes plans to hire an extra 10,000 staff (1,048 doctors, 3,517 nurses, and up to 200 midwives). The public-sector wage cap has also been lifted to 3 per cent this year, with a further 0.5 per cent increase next year, taking it to 3.5 per cent. Several unions in the sector have criticised the 3 per cent rise as a cut in real terms, as it is lower than inflation. There's also $883 million set aside over the next four years to attract and retain health workers in the bush, and more than $400 million to fast-track elective surgeries delayed due to COVID-19. Community-led Indigenous initiatives will receive funding as part of a $401 million investment to help ""close the gap"" in life expectancy between First Nations people and the national average. The NSW Coalition of Aboriginal Peak Organisations will lead the program. When challenged on the Coalition's failures in the years they have been in office, Mr Perrottet said there were always things governments could do better. ""You've always got to be looking at new ways and innovative policy solutions. I think that's what has come through here,"" he said. ""I'm sick of us not getting ahead in this space."" Money will also go to agencies within the Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisations to promote groups that safeguard Indigenous language and culture, with grants of up to $250,000. The $401 million investment will come from a $716 million pool of funds for Indigenous housing, culture, language and community services. It's hoped the other funds will be used to help make 4,400 homes in First Nations communities climate resistant, and build new family centres, as well as record and preserve Indigenous languages. A total of $119 million will be injected into the research and development of ribonucleic acid (RNA) technology over the next 10 years. Advances in this field were crucial to creating the messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccines, including those produced by Pfizer and Moderna. The investment is expected to increase NSW's capability to combat the next pandemic, as well as cancer and genetic diseases. Science Minister Alister Henskens said the collaboration would be made between the government and 14 NSW and ACT universities. ""The value of RNA technology has been proven throughout the pandemic through the use of mRNA vaccines, but we know that vaccines are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to RNA,"" he said. ""By bringing together our world-leading universities and industry leaders, we can deliver innovative solutions to some of the most important and complex challenges facing the world."" Almost half a million motorists will be eligible for quarterly rebates on their toll bills as the government tries to address the rising cost of living in NSW. The $520 million budget commitment over the next two years will apply to drivers who spend at least $375 on tolls a year. Drivers can get up to $750 cash back, a move that is set to benefit Western Sydney drivers who are hardest hit by tolls. The rebate program which replaces the existing half-price registration scheme will take effect from July 1. Mr Kean said the cost was a ""small price to pay"" to ensure motorists get more cash back. Despite rising construction costs, there's more than $600 million over the next four years in the budget to build stage two of the Parramatta Light Rail. Member for Parramatta Geoff Lee said the investment would support the growing population along the Parramatta River. ""This will connect people from the Parramatta CBD to Sydney Olympic Park via the growing Camellia, Rydalmere, Ermington, Melrose Park and Wentworth Point,"" Mr Lee said. Meanwhile, $60 million has been put aside to connect Parramatta to Circular Quay via a 91km pathway. A further $2.8 billion in transport infrastructure spending affecting Western Sydney is included in the budget. That encompasses $243.1 million to help ease congestion on Prospect Highway while $1.2 billion will be spent over the next four years to upgrade the M12 to the under-construction Western Sydney International Airport. The airport and its surrounds is the target of significant investment, about $163 million for buildings, remediation of the site and research facilities in the precinct. Hospitals in Rouse Hill and Liverpool will be given a share of $480 million for upgrades. There will be $9.5 million to fix the paths in parks across the western suburbs, and $15 million to build a special fence around the Georges River Koala Reserve. Power is becoming more expensive and the new financial year, which starts next month, will see prices rise. The default market offer (DMO) — the highest price a retailer can charge a customer for power — is going up between 8.5 and 14.1 per cent in NSW. While a complex series of national and international factors are impacting Australia's electricity sector, there is no immediate relief in the NSW budget for customers. Mr Kean also announced an investment of $1.2 billion for renewable energy transmission. Plans for a tunnel that would have connected the northern beaches to the Warringah Freeway and the rest of Sydney are on ice. The project would have connected the peninsular to an upgraded Warringah Freeway and, ultimately, WestConnex via a new road tunnel under Sydney Harbour. But rising construction costs meant Infrastructure NSW suggested shelving most of the state's mega-projects, and the Beaches Link was a casualty. The project was expected to cost $6.3 billion over four years of construction and was slated for completion in 2028. Women have been prioritised in the budget. The biggest spend by far — more than $10 billion — has been on improving affordability and accessibility of child care, and an overhaul of the preschool system, with the aim of making it more financially viable for women to get back in the workforce. Details of these policies can be found in the working parents section of this story. Then there has been $100 million offered for domestic violence support services and anti-street harassment initiatives, on top of funding commitments for IVF and menopause hubs. Public schools in the state will be given $1.6 billion for upgrades and new buildings. The education infrastructure funding will help specific schools in Albury, Concord, Lennox Head and Rouse Hill, among others. For parents, there will be a pool of $193 million for school supplies. Each child who attends a primary of secondary school will be eligible for a $150 subsidy. The only requirement is that children must be NSW residents, enrolled in school next year and listed on a Medicare card. The plan will come into effect on January 1 and run until June next year. Parents will also be able to send children to a pre-Kindergarten year of schooling. The $5.8 billion plan will be rolled out over 10 years to have students in pre-K by 2030. For those travelling to university there will be $98 million given for a regional apprentice and university student travel card, worth $250. The government has put $95 million aside to help make a fast rail link from Sydney to Newcastle a reality. Mr Perrottet previously committed $500 million to the plan in collaboration with the Commonwealth Government, making a total $1 billion available. ""Once this becomes a reality we will be seeing travel times between Sydney and Newcastle [reduced] from two and a half hours down to one hour, Sydney to Gosford in 25 minutes, then Sydney to Wollongong in 45 minutes,"" Mr Perrottet said. The $95 million will be used to upgrade existing infrastructure. Mr Perrottet said the works were an essential step in delivering his government's six cities vision, by improving accessibility between the state's major centres. ""You can't build great cities without building significant transport infrastructure, and ... this billion dollars from the state and federal government will lay that foundation and set up further investments as we move forward,"" he said. Commuters will also benefit environmentally with zero-emission buses hitting the road, which should reduce the noises, improve air quality and make for a smoother ride. The budget has outlined $219 million for the new hi-tech fleet over the next seven years. Around 200 zero-emission buses are expected to be in service on roads by mid-2023. While home buyers have plenty of measures to celebrate in this year's budget, there's less support for renters. The NSW Council of Social Services (NCOSS) said more could be done to help those in social housing and people that require affordable renting schemes. ""More households are doing it tough because of cost-of-living pressures and communities need more support, specifically around affordable housing,"" NCOSS CEO Joanna Quilty said. ""The affordable housing crisis was prevalent before the pandemic, COVID-19 has worsened it and it has also been exacerbated by an unholy trinity of flood, fire and drought."" Ms Quilty has called for an increase funding for the social services sector, above the one-off $50 million social sector support fund created at the height of the COVID-19 lockdowns. The government has committed $300 million to upgrade 15,800 social homes, but NCOSS said with 50,000 people on waitlists to enter social housing, the upgrades fall well short of what's needed.

63,"'Qantas's brand is very, very tarnished': Travellers suffering through disruptions as industry scrambles to find workers",business,"  Australian air travellers have been warned to expect more disruptions over the next 12 months, as the industry scrambles to fill critical worker shortages ahead of the July school holidays. It's been a torrid few months for passengers, who have faced delays, cancellations and missing luggage over the recent Easter break and the Queen's Birthday long weekend. Employers are rushing to fill 5,000 job vacancies around the Sydney Airport precinct, which shed 15,000 jobs during the border shutdown. Chief executive of Sydney Airport Geoff Culbert told 7.30 airports would continue to struggle to recruit enough workers in time for peak periods. ""I'm not going to sugar-coat it,"" Mr Culbert said. ""It's going to be challenging. We're still going to have staff shortages in the June-July school holidays. We're throwing everything we possibly can at it. ""I think you're going to see airports struggling for staffing and recruitment for the next 12 months."" Sydney Airport is urging domestic travellers to arrive two hours before their flight, and international travellers to arrive three hours ahead, to allow for delays. Across the world, airports are struggling to deal with the resurgence of travellers. Customers have vented their frustrations with Australian airlines on social media, complaining of flight delays, cancellations, missing baggage, hours-long queues at airports, inability to reach call centre staff, and accusations of unfair terms and conditions on flight credits. ABC's 7.30 has spoken to Qantas and Virgin passengers, whose luggage has been missing since April. ""I followed up with Virgin multiple times and was just told the same story: 'The bag's coming' … but it just never came,"" traveller Clinton Press said. Mr Press said he was unsatisfied with the amount Virgin had offered in compensation. Virgin declined to be interviewed but said it was working around the clock to help their customers. Long-time Qantas customer Kevin Burke travelled from Darwin to London on a series of connecting flights. He told ABC's 7.30 the trip was plagued with problems. ""I think Qantas' brand is very, very tarnished. The service is not up to scratch,"" he said. ""When we arrived at Heathrow, the pilot told us that the entire plane's luggage had been left in Australia to make room for fuel."" Mr Burke's luggage arrived three days later. Last Thursday, a Qantas flight from Dallas to Sydney was cancelled at 2am, due to an engineering issue, leaving many to sleep on the airport's floor, including some of the Gaudin family. ""No one was telling us what was going on,"" traveller Kat Gaudin said. ""When the [kids] woke up, they were cranky, hungry, a little bit confused."" The mother of four said she felt ""let down"" by the national carrier. Qantas has apologised for the inconvenience caused to passengers on the flight. The company's chief executive, Alan Joyce, has shifted his language after he faced a customer backlash over his comments that passengers were not ""match fit"" over Easter, conceding the industry was ""rusty"" as it got back up and running. Mr Joyce declined to speak to ABC's 7.30, but told reporters in Doha on Sunday night, ""there are blocks in the chain all the way through"". In a statement, Qantas said it was ""working hard to fix the problems we have"" and has apologised to customers who have had their baggage delayed. ""We've got a lot of confidence leading in to the school holidays [that] we'll see a different outcome."" The Transport Workers' Union argues Qantas's outsourcing of workers in 2020 has led to the current problems. ""This is about a fundamental structural problem within aviation that has been deliberately created by Qantas over the course of the Joyce administration,"" TWU national secretary Michael Kaine said. The Federal Court later found the sackings were illegal and the airline now plans to appeal to the High Court. A TWU survey of 1,100 former Qantas workers outsourced in 2020 found that, while the majority have found new jobs, 70 per cent say they are worse off. And 71 per cent say they have experienced financial hardship, while 30 per cent have developed depression or anxiety. Qantas denies the union's claims on outsourcing.

64,"Reserve Bank governor says inflation is rising, but he doesn't see a recession on the horizon",business,"  Reserve Bank governor says inflation is rising, but he doesn't see a recession on the horizon Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe has warned inflation is increasingly coming from within Australia, but he doesn't see a recession occurring at this stage. He says the RBA still thinks inflation will hit 7 per cent this year, up from 5.1 per cent currently, but it is monitoring the situation. Mr Lowe has also admitted the RBA suffered ""reputational damage"" when it tried to wind back its COVID-19 pandemic stimulus program. Speaking on Tuesday at an event in Sydney, the RBA governor said the share of items in the consumer price index (CPI) basket experiencing annual price increases greater than 3 per cent was at its highest level since 1990. He said the RBA has had to adjust its forecasts higher for retail electricity and gas prices, given the problems with energy supply on Australia's eastern seaboard. But he also couldn't see a sharp slowdown in economic activity occurring in coming years, from this vantage point. ""I don't see a recession on the horizon,"" Mr Lowe said. ""If the last two years has taught us anything, it's that you can't rule anything out. But our fundamentals are strong, the position of the household sector is strong, and firms are wanting to hire people at record rates. ""It doesn't feel like a precursor to a recession,"" he said. Mr Lowe said current conditions were obviously challenging, but there were other positive things to say about the economy. The Australian share market has dropped by more than 15 per cent from its record high, sliding closer towards a bear market. Some investors may be tempted to ""buy the dip"", but analysts say there is ""further downside"" ahead. He said Australia's unemployment rate was the lowest in 50 years, the participation rate was at a record high, job vacancies were at record-high levels, and households had strong balance sheets. Mr Lowe said the ""terms of trade"" — which compares the prices we receive for our exports against the prices we pay for imports — was at its highest-ever level. ""When we had the resources boom a decade ago I used to say, 'This is the highest since 1848, when we had the gold rushes in the British colonies' and, yet, here we are today, in 2022, having a higher terms of trade, which is really boosting our national income,"" he said. ""So there are a lot of positives."" Mr Lowe said interest rates had increased recently, but the cash rate was still less than 1 per cent, which is historically low. He also said he did not think the unemployment rate needed to rise to get inflation back down to into the RBA's preferred 2-3 per cent range, but it was possible that it might rise at some point. However, he said, he did not think underlying inflation — currently 3.7 per cent — would return to the 2-3 per cent range for a couple of years. ""It's a couple of years away,"" Mr Lowe said. ""But we have not yet done a full update of our forecasts following the May update. Philip Lowe has warned Australians they need to be prepared for substantial interest rate rises over the rest of this year, conceding he is not sure how high they might go. ""In the next month or so, we'll be doing a full forecast update, but it's going to be some years, I think, before inflation is back in the 2-3 per cent range."" He said he was travelling to Switzerland this week to meet other central bank governors, to talk about the world's inflation problems. He said the RBA was walking a narrow path between trying to normalise interest rates, keeping inflation expectations low, and still supporting employment. And he admitted the RBA had suffered some reputational damage recently. Mr Lowe said the RBA's attempt to remove stimulus from the economy in late 2021 also ran into problems. He said it was ""disorderly and associated with bond market volatility and some dislocation in the market."" ""This experience caused some reputational damage to the Bank,"" he said. The RBA has released a paper explaining what occurred.

65,"A gas export tax would help to fix Australia's energy crisis, says Dr Ken Henry",business,"  Gas export tax would help to fix Australia's energy crisis, says Dr Ken Henry The dire state of Australia's domestic electricity market, and our lack of investment in renewables, has been a mess of our own making, former Treasury secretary Ken Henry has said. Australia has also squandered its opportunity to use its huge domestic gas reserves as a transitional fuel to shift our electricity system away from a heavy reliance on coal to renewables, he says. ""It's been squandered through politicking — partly ideological, partly I think driven by personal ambition — and it's put us in a very bad place,"" he told the ABC this week. ""It's too late to have the sort of reliance upon gas-fired power as a transitional fuel that we were imagining last century."" Dr Henry, who was Australia's Treasury secretary from 2001 to 2011, argued in 2004 that Australia should adopt a national emissions trading scheme. In his 2010 Tax Review, he warned energy markets could become unstable if investors weren't provided with sufficient certainty to make long-term investment plans for renewable energy. Now, looking back, he says no-one involved in energy policy-making in the late 1990s and early 2000s could say that they didn't see Australia's current energy crisis coming. But a gas export windfall tax could help to fix things, he said. Dr Henry spoke to the ABC following one of the most tumultuous weeks in Australia's energy policy experience. Last week, the electricity system on Australia's eastern seaboard was thrown into chaos as a shortage of power supply ran headlong into spikes in demand as people increased their energy use during a severe cold snap. Some fossil-fuel generators had withdrawn a huge amount of capacity from National Electricity Market, which worsened the forecast shortage of electricity and prompted unprecedented regulatory intervention. The National Electricity Market is in dire need of repair. How long will it take to fix? asks Gareth Hutchens. There were dire warnings about possible blackouts, which prompted politicians to ask voters to switch off appliances to avoid catastrophic stresses on the system. And the crisis of skyrocketing gas prices continued, as multinationals made extraordinary profits exporting Australian gas overseas. Dr Henry said it was a situation we shouldn't be in. ""It's bizarre isn't it?"" he said. ""We've got a global energy price shock, energy prices around the world are going through the roof. Australia is an energy superpower; we have an abundance of just about every source of energy imaginable. ""And yet, we've got multinational companies making extraordinary windfall profits while Australian households, and Australian manufacturers reliant upon energy, are getting it in the neck. ""How did we end up in this place?"" Dr Henry said Australia's political leaders blew their opportunity to have more control over Australia's gas fields to help us transition our energy system to renewable energy. He said the current crisis was foreseeable, and it's been a disaster long in the making. ""Many people will remember that 25 years ago the Kyoto Protocol was signed, in 1997. It came into force in 2005,"" he said. ""That gave Australia eight years to design an optimal policy approach for climate change. In an energy crisis that pits gas exporters against Australia, there are two possible actions for the new Albanese government to take, writes Ian Verrender. ""Senior public servants in Canberra readily came to the conclusion that an optimal policy response would be an economy-wide price on carbon,"" he said. A Coalition government, led by prime minister John Howard, was in power from 1996 to 2007. Dr Henry said a price on carbon could have been introduced in different ways, either with an emissions trading scheme or a carbon tax of some sort. But it was ""very important"" that a price on carbon be introduced as quickly as possible, before Kyoto came into force, to help the business community make long-term investment decisions as Australia prepared to shift to a heavy reliance on renewables. ""And the reason was that, way back then, last century, people had in mind that the Australian electricity system would go through phases,"" he said. ""From a heavy reliance upon coal, to a transitional phase that would be heavily reliant upon gas-fired power generators, until we got to the third phase, and the ultimate phase, of heavy reliance upon renewable energy. ""But the risk was that if we didn't get the policy settings right, way back then, we would miss out on the opportunity to rely upon our vast gas reserves as a transitional energy fuel. ""And guess what? That's what we've done."" Australia's oil and gas resources are overwhelmingly exploited by global multinationals — in fact, there's barely any local equity involved. A Labor government, in power federally between 2007 and 2013, eventually introduced a carbon pricing scheme late in 2012, but it was repealed by the next Coalition government in 2014. Meanwhile, gas prices on Australia's east coast have been deliberately linked to global gas prices — with no reservation policy for Australian households — and multinationals are making extraordinary profits exporting our gas overseas. Dr Henry said it was a situation we shouldn't be in, but we couldn't turn the clock back. However, he said if we still wanted to have a ""gas-led recovery"" we'd have to do something about the domestic price of gas. And the simplest way to do that would be with taxation, he said. We could start pushing domestic gas prices back down for Australian consumers and manufacturers by heavily taxing the windfall profits of the multinational gas companies. ""Given where we are now, I do think a gas export windfall tax would be the most effective way to reduce the domestic price below the world price,"" he said. ""[It would] guarantee sufficient supply of gas for domestic users, both households and businesses, and of course it would have the additional benefit of generating very substantial revenue for the budget."" He said there was ""no economic case"" why those windfall profits couldn't be taxed at a rate of 100 per cent.

66,Qantas to land a full-time engineer at Broome International Airport to overcome cancellations,business,"  Qantas to overcome Broome International Airport flight disruptions with full-time engineer Qantas is set to base a full-time aircraft engineer in Broome to alleviate flight cancellations that are forcing locals to house stranded passengers who cannot find accommodation. The cancellations are affecting the Western Australian tourism hotspot at the busiest time of the year, as accommodation prices soar and rooms book out months in advance. Qantas, which has seen a raft of cancellations at Broome International Airport over the past two months, said the disruptions had been driven by ""COVID-related staff challenges"" and ""engineering requirements"". The airline confirmed to the ABC that it had sent a full-time engineer to service flights at the town's airport to tackle technical issues. ""We now have a full-time engineer based in Broome and [are] working to build up our local engineering capabilities to minimise the risk of cancellations,"" a spokesperson said. Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association (ALAEA) federal secretary Steve Purvinas said the move followed cuts to permanent staff in the state's north west. He said two engineers based at Karratha Airport prior to the pandemic were regularly transported to airports around the north-west to service Qantas aircraft. Mr Purvinas said that changed after the pandemic hit, with the airline pulling a flight engineer out of Karratha Airport who serviced many communities in the Pilbara region. ""This wasn't a one-off COVID event. It was a permanent de-manning of that port,"" he said. ""The [engineering] problems that have happened in Broome this year are not because someone was sick from COVID. ""Broome hasn't been manned [by a full-time engineer] for 20 years."" He said the airline had now ""thrown a QantasLink bloke permanently into Broome, which we think is a better option"". ""The steps are positive, but it can't undo the delays that passengers have suffered up until now,"" Mr Purvinas said. Residents and business operators in Broome were frustrated by the flight cancellations, which they said had left the town to deal with the consequences. Repeated cancellations by both Virgin and Qantas at the eleventh hour are leaving tourists struggling to find last minute accommodation in Broome Shire of Broome president Harold Tracey said the ""disappointing"" situation may have left tourists with a bad feeling after their holiday. ""When you're stuck at an airport waiting to get back home, it doesn't matter where you are,"" he said. ""It's not going to leave you with the most endearing memory."" Passenger Anthony Hinkley was frustrated by a cancellation two weeks ago but was astounded by the kindness of locals who housed him after Qantas staff could not find accommodation. ""I saw people just turn up at the airport, ladies, gentleman, all sorts of different people, [and say], 'I've got a room. Who would like to come?', and, bang, they would just go,"" he said. ""So my experience in Broome was: Love the people, loved everything I did up there. ""Would I come again? Yes, but I'll fly with Virgin next time."" Virgin Australia has also cancelled several flights at Broome International Airport. Delays and cancellations have become the new normal at airports around Australia, which have experienced a surge in flights after COVID-19 restrictions eased, but without enough staff to service them. Last week Qantas announced it would cut the number of flights in regional WA over the next month to manage the impact of COVID-19 on staffing levels.

67,"ASX rebounds as Reserve Bank admits it suffered 'reputational damage', bitcoin recovers above $US21,000",business,"  ASX rebounds as Reserve Bank admits it suffered 'reputational damage', bitcoin recovers above $US21,000 Australian shares have finally rebounded, after plummeting for seven straight days into correction territory on high inflation and recession worries. The ASX 200 closed 1.4 per cent higher, at 6,524 points on Tuesday. The financial sector boosted the market, with shares of Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, ANZ and NAB rising between 2.4 and 3.8 per cent. It comes as Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe said he expects to discuss hiking interest rates by either 0.25 or 0.5 percentage points at the RBA's July policy meeting. Dr Lowe also downplayed the possibility of a larger hike, and said he does not see Australia falling into recession. Mining giants BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals also lifted sharply, by around 1.7 to 3.5 per cent. Energy stocks were some of the best performers, like Whitehaven Coal (+5.3pc), Beach Energy (+4.5pc) and Paladin Energy (+8pc). Shares of Novonix (+4.3pc), Pointsbet (+9pc), Chalice Mining (+2.7pc) and Imugene (+6.7pc) also rose sharply. The Australian share market has dropped by more than 15 per cent from its record high, sliding closer towards a bear market. Some investors may be tempted to ""buy the dip"", but analysts say there is ""further downside"" ahead. By 4:30pm AEST, the Australian dollar was slightly higher, at 69.6 US cents. But it remains near its weakest level since July 2020. It is partly being weighed down by falling iron ore prices, on worries about the impact of China's COVID-zero policy. China is the biggest buyer of Australian iron ore, and the price of the steel-making ingredient has plunged 8 per cent to around $US112 a tonne, according to ANZ data. ""Further falls in iron ore prices can add to downside pressure on the Australian dollar today,"" said Commonwealth Bank currency strategist Carol Kong. Ms Kong also said the local currency can slip further because of the ""coming sharp slowdown in the world economy"", and has forecast it will trade within a range of 60 - 70 US cents for most of the next 12 months. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency industry was on edge as bitcoin recovered tepidly above $US21,000 and investors feared that problems at major crypto players could unleash a wider market shake-out. Oil prices swung higher in volatile trading, with Brent crude futures rising 0.9 per cent, to $US114.13 a barrel. Spot gold was little changed in holiday-thinned trading, at $US1,837.46 per ounce. In a rare admission, the Reserve Bank said that it has suffered ""reputational damage"" due to how it handled the ending of its pandemic-era stimulus program (designed to keep short-term bond yields low). The financial fate of many Australians will be decided over the next few days, as the price of many cryptocurrencies plunges and one major crypto-lender locks customers out of their own accounts. The RBA said its ""yield curve control"" stimulus was successful for much of its 21-month life. However, the bank has conceded that its withdrawal from the program in late 2021 was ""disorderly"". The programme began in March 2020 as part of a massive COVID-19 stimulus package. It was initially aimed at keeping yields on three-year Australian government bonds around 0.25 per cent, though it was lowered to 0.1 per cent later that year. For most of its life, the plan worked to keep yields and market interest rates lower than they would otherwise have been and to put downward pressure on the local dollar. But in late 2021, yields began to rise as the market began to price in the risk of an earlier-than-expected increase in the cash rate. The RBA initially bought bonds to defend the target but in late October stepped away from the market, sending yields surging and triggering heavy losses in bond futures. The central bank acknowledged its yield target should have ended earlier. The RBA also said it was unlikely to adopt this strategy again, preferring to just purchase bonds in set amounts across maturities. Wall Street was closed for the Juneteenth public holiday, while European markets recovered some of their losses from the recent sell-off. There are fears we could be on the verge of another global recession and investors are spooked. The pan-European STOXX 600 jumped 1 per cent overnight, with battered banking, travel and energy stocks leading the gains. That index has shed almost 17 per cent this year so far, as a cocktail of worries from soaring inflation to China's slowing economy and a cost-of-living crisis in the UK dampen investors' appetite for risk. Overnight, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde reaffirmed plans to raise interest rates, twice, in the next few months, while fighting widening spreads in the borrowing costs of different euro zone countries. ""We'll continue to see some volatility because inflation, in our view, is not going to start to come down until the end of this year,"" said Willem Sels, global chief investment officer at HSBC. Bitcoin — the world's biggest cryptocurrency — dropped on Saturday to as low as $US17,593, falling below the key $US20,000 level for the first time since December 2020. So far this year, the volatile cryptocurrency has lost 55 per cent of its value — and 35 per cent this month alone in the cryptocurrency sector's latest meltdown. Bitcoin's fall follows problems at several major crypto firms. Further declines, market players said, could have a knock-on effect as other crypto investors are forced to sell their holdings to meet margin calls and cover their losses. Crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital is exploring options, including the sale of assets and a bailout by another firm, its founders told the Wall Street Journal in a story published on Friday. It was also the same day that Asia-focused crypto lender Babel Finance said it would suspend withdrawals. ""We've likely seen the worst of things, in terms of any singular entity suffering, but most in the industry are braced for more to come,"" said head of financial strategy at fund management firm Solrise Finance Joseph Edwards. US-based lender Celsius Network this month said it would suspend customer withdrawals. In a blog on Monday, Celsius said it would continue working with regulators and officials, but that it would pause its customer Q&A sessions. ""There is a lot of credit being withdrawn from the system and, if lenders have to absorb losses from Celsius and Three Arrows, they will reduce the size of their future loan books, which means that the entire amount of credit available in the crypto ecosystem is much reduced,"" said chief risk office for Japan at crypto liquidity provider B2C2 Adam Farthing. ""It feels very like 2008 to me, in terms of how there could be a domino effect of bankruptcies and liquidations,"" he added. Smaller tokens, which usually move in tandem with bitcoin, were also hurt. Philip Lowe has warned Australians they need to be prepared for substantial interest rate rises over the rest of this year, conceding he is not sure how high they might go. The second-largest cryptocurrency, ether, was at $US1,129, having dipped below its own symbolic level of $US1,000 over the weekend. Recent falls in crypto markets have coincided with a sell-off on stock markets, as Wall Street last week suffered its biggest weekly percentage decline in two years on fears of rising interest rates and the growing likelihood of a recession in the US. Bitcoin's moves have tended to follow a similar pattern to other risk assets, such as tech stocks. The overall crypto market capitalisation is roughly $US900 billion, according to price site Coinmarketcap, down from a peak of $2.9 trillion in November 2021. A fall in stablecoins — a type of crypto designed to hold a steady value — is also suggesting investors are pulling money from the sector as a whole.

68,'It's not a representative sample': Why the RBA's wages growth data should be questioned,business,"  Where did the RBA find evidence of wage growth? The Reserve Bank of Australia is coming under increasing scrutiny, with reports revealing Treasurer Jim Chalmers is close to finalising an independent review into the bank. Much of the criticism is over the central bank's forward guidance during the pandemic that interest rates were not expected to rise until at least 2024. The pandemic and the economic crisis that came with it brought about a recession and record-low wage growth. Part of the Reserve Bank's policy response was to cut already-low interest rates to record lows. Then, on May 3, 2022, the bank decided to raise the cash rate for the first time in over a decade. But it is not clear how the RBA concluded that there was ""stronger upward pressure"" on wages growth occurring. In a rare press conference following the decision to raise interest rates, RBA governor Phillip Lowe said the bank had been waiting for evidence of higher wages growth to justify — in part — a decision to raise rates. ""This focus on trends in labour costs was evident in the board's communication after the previous meeting when we stated that over coming months we would be assessing important additional evidence on both inflation and the evolution of labour costs,"" Mr Lowe said. The bank obtains evidence of wage growth from its in-house liaison program as well as through well-established business surveys. The liaison program involves 70 meetings a month, on average, between the RBA and businesses — the majority being individual firms varying in size from large to small. In April, there were 63 meetings under the formal liaison program. Most of these meetings were with individual entities, but some included more. The RBA says one of the meetings in April had 15 firms present. ""While the various data compiled by the ABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics) have not yet been released, other evidence received over the past month through our business liaison and our business surveys has indicated that there is now strong upwards pressure now on labour costs and that this is likely to continue,"" Mr Lowe said. But Rae Dufty-Jones, an economist and associate professor at the University of Western Sydney, said it was not appropriate for the Reserve Bank to use that data alone as evidence of larger wage increases. ""It's not a representative sample,"" Dr Dufty-Jones told The Drum. ""It would not be what you would describe as statistically valid."" In other words, the data could be used to provide context or further insight into a more statistically based trend that was observed from statistically valid sources of data. ""But that in itself should not inform monetary policy,"" she said. ""It doesn't provide you with an overall picture of all businesses and where they sit in terms of wages."" Former chief economist of the ANZ Bank, Saul Eslake, agreed with Dr Dufty-Jones. ""Sixty businesses hardly constitutes a statistically reliable survey,"" he said. The Financial Review's economics editor, John Kehoe, told The Drum: ""I imagine that they'd be speaking to people like Woolworths and Coles, and some of the other big employers as well were sort of telling [the Reserve Bank], 'Our wages bill is about to go up from about 3 per cent.' Some were saying it might even get to 4 per cent. But it's a difficult balancing act."" ""Even that, total employment is many millions of people, so it's very small sample size,"" Mr Eslake said in response to Kehoe's comments. ""I think the RBA had dug itself into a hole whereby it needed evidence that wages growth was starting to accelerate in order to satisfy its precondition for starting to raise rates, that underlying inflation was sustainably within the 2 to 3 per cent target range."" ""They couldn't find that evidence in any of the ABS wages data and went fishing and caught a tadpole."" In a statement to the Drum, the RBA said: ""The Board's decision in May was in response to the accumulation of evidence over several months through various types of liaison; it was not based on a single month's worth of meetings."" But the bank admitted that ""contacts are asked how much they were raising wages by"" and they ""don't ask for documentary evidence of actual wages paid"". The RBA also relies on established business surveys, which include measures of wage growth. But on examination of the surveys used, it is questionable whether their results — which informed the bank's decision to raise interest rates in May — show any evidence of strong wage growth. The RBA refers to the Australian Industry Group's business survey, which contains a ""wages index"". But it measures the number of businesses lifting wages — not the size of those pay increases. The RBA also refers to the National Australia Bank's business survey, which shows growth in labour costs, but that is simply because many more Australians are in employment. Two weeks after the first rate rise in May, the Australian Bureau of Statistics also released its closely watched Wage Price Index. But that showed relatively low wage growth of just 0.7 per cent over the three months to December, and then again from January to March. ""There hasn't been any evidence for some years around increase of wages growth despite promises by the previous federal government,"" Dr Dufty-Jones. While the Fair Work Commission's decision last week to raise the minimum wage is certainly a welcome shift, the Reserve Bank's decision to lift the cash rate target means households with an average mortgage of $5,000 per month will be paying hundreds of extra dollars in monthly mortgage payments. The central bank faces a federal government review. The Treasurer is yet to announce the details.

70,live: NSW now: Police lay hundreds of charges in crackdown on knife crime,business,"  Sydney news: NSW Police target increasing knife crime among young people Here's what you need to know this morning. Police have seized more than 110 knives, 21 firearms and charged 232 people as part of a statewide crackdown on knife-related crime. Operation Foil II took place from June 14 to June 18 to reduce the number of young people carrying knives in public, and prevent violent incidents that cause significant harm. The statewide operation involved highly-visible police patrols in high-risk locations, as well as Youth Command Officers visiting high schools to warn teens about the risks of carrying weapons. It follows an increase in the number of young people becoming both perpetrators and victims of knife-related offences in the past five years. Commissioner Karen Webb said the force was reminding young people about the impacts of having a dangerous weapon. ""Our intelligence shows that some young people are increasingly carrying sharp instruments for self-defence, but they don't fully understand the potentially fatal consequences that this can have,"" she said. ""When someone has a dangerous weapon in their possession, there is a much greater likelihood of a small-scale incident escalating into a fatal one."" One person has died in a fierce house fire that erupted this morning in the Blue Mountains. Superintendent Adam Newberry, from Fire and Rescue NSW, said crews were called to Regent Street, Katoomba about 5am after reports of a large blaze. Firefighters were told a person residing in the home was unaccounted-for but crews were unable to enter the property due to intense flames. It took an hour-and-a-half to control the fire, before a body was discovered on the second floor. Four trucks and 16 firefighters attended the scene this morning. Police and fire investigators are still establishing the cause of the blaze. NSW's five major integrity agencies, including the Independent Commission Against Corruption, are set to receive $440 million in extra funding in today's state budget. A government official said the money had been allocated after requests for more support. Other agencies to see increased funding in the next financial year are the NSW Electoral Commission, the Ombudsman, the Audit Office and the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission. The non-government sector is calling for the state government to index grants given to charities and other community groups that rely on funding to pay wages. From July 1, the national minimum wage will increase by $40 a week, which amounts to an increase of 5.2 per cent. NSW Council of Social Service chief executive Joanna Quilty said that, while the decision was most welcome, most sector organisations relied on grants from the state government to pay their workers. She said the money should be allocated in today's Budget so that there is certainty. ""It's a guessing game. We are never quite sure how much will flow through and it's absolutely vital that, this time around, it's adequate so services are able to meet that 5.2 per cent minimum wage increase,"" Ms Quilty said. A deadline extension has been granted for Western Sydney organisations applying for millions in government funding to create or improve local infrastructure. Applications for the WestInvest grants program has been extended until 5pm on July 25, 2022, with successful projects to be awarded in December 2022. So far, 15 councils and more than 1,000 organisations who submitted a registration of interest are eligible to apply for funding. Treasurer Matt Kean said some applicants had asked for more time to complete their applications for the ""once-in-a-generation opportunity"". Western Sydney Minister Stuart Ayres welcomed the extension. ""Allowing applicants more time will result in better applications and ensure that we are funding truly transformational projects for communities in Western Sydney,"" Mr Ayres said. A renewed White Bay Power Station could be the Harbour City's answer to London's Tate Modern — the UK's national arts collection — says NSW Cities Minister Rob Stokes. The 105-year-old site, located in Sydney's bays precinct, would be the centrepiece for a state government plan to redevelop the precinct. Treasurer Matt Kean says $49 million has been allocated to fund remediation work for the power station in today's state budget. ""This will allow government to restore and transform this important piece of NSW history on Sydney's harbour foreshore, removing lead and asbestos and making the building safe for future use,"" he said. Mr Stokes said remediation would take about two years. Place Management NSW has been tasked with examining feedback from a draft master plan exhibition and determining a process for the future use of the power station. ""The White Bay Power Station could be Sydney's answer to London's Tate Modern, only we have a much nicer harbour,"" Mr Stokes said. ""The restoration of this former [coal-fired] power station will power Sydney's most-anticipated urban renewal project in generations and spark enormous investment."" Partly cloudy.

71,Worried about lettuce? Try living in one of the world's most expensive cities as inflation surges,business,"  Worried about the cost of living? This is the impact inflation is having in some of the world's most expensive cities Australia isn't the only country seeing everyday items like iceberg lettuce go from basic to bougie. Across the globe, people are feeling the pinch as surging inflation becomes a ""global phenomenon"". In some countries, people are already witnessing grocery prices doubling and experts say we're yet to see inflation peak. This is how life is being impacted in some of the most expensive cities in the world. In Hong Kong, Yifan Jin chooses to live in a long-stay hotel close to where she works as a tax consultant rather than rent an apartment. The 26-year-old pays around $HK12,000 ($2,177) per month — an amount she says would not guarantee her a ""good and decent"" flat. ""For $HK12,000, you can only rent rooms in old buildings, with broken toilets, thin glass windows, all kinds of problems,"" Ms Jin told the ABC. Ms Jin describes herself as a ""Hong Kong drifter"", referring to a group born in mainland China but living in Hong Kong. She said most ""Hong Kong drifters"" spend more than one-third of their salaries on rent, which makes life difficult as cost of living rises in the notoriously expensive city. After paying for rent, food and other daily necessities ""there's nothing left"", she said. Hong Kong was ranked at the top of ECA International's 2022 list of most expensive cities to live in. The global mobility company's annual report compares commonly purchased consumer goods, household staples, rents, public transport, and factors in the strength of local currency. The report considered 207 cities in 120 countries and territories, focusing on expats and foreign workers. Although Hong Kong has been less impacted by rising global inflation than other locations, price increases were higher than what is typically witnessed in the city, the report said. It found that a cup of coffee was around $7 and 1 kilogram of tomatoes had gone up to $16.39. Anna Michielsen, ECA's Australia, New Zealand and Pacific general manager, was shocked at the rate at which prices were increasing for everyday goods. ""We're surprised at how quickly and across how many locations inflation has escalated,"" Ms Michielsen said. ""We're not alone in this in any way, shape or form."" No Australian capital cities were among the 10 most expensive, but were all ranked in the top 100, except for Hobart which wasn't included in the report. Sydney was ranked as the most expensive Australian city, coming in at 39. Five of the top cities ranked in the ECA report were in Asia, including Shanghai, which came in at number eight. Jerry Jiang started experiencing skyrocketing food prices about two months ago when China imposed strict COVID lockdowns on the country's second-largest city. ""In April, Shanghai faced a supply shortage at the beginning of the lockdown for a while, so prices surged very fast,"" he said. ""Everything is getting more expensive, like dining out, getting a haircut, rents, petrol, et cetera."" Tomatoes cost almost double what they did a year ago. Mr Jiang is still under lockdown, meaning he is forced to shop online, which is more expensive than at the markets. Katrina Ell, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics, said the pandemic was the initial trigger for the increases, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine created a scenario that ""no one expected"". Ukraine's war with Russia is exacerbating an already alarming global food crisis. ""Just as the pandemic was kind of easing off, Russia's invasion of Ukraine threw another spanner in the works and really pushed inflation beyond expectations,"" Ms Ell told the ABC. ""What we're seeing is that it's almost been a perfect storm of factors that have really driven this surge in acceleration that has been a global phenomenon."" The war has pushed up the price of food and energy because both Russia and Ukraine are important suppliers of those commodities. ""Ukraine is an important supplier of fertiliser, wheat, and other really critical non-specific food items. So that's an additional kind of push,"" Ms Ell said. Cities across Asia have been particularly impacted due to their reliance on food and energy imports. ""Within Asia, there are some interesting dynamics at play,"" Ms Ell said. ""Places like Singapore import all their food needs… they're really exposed to that spike in global prices."" Some countries are also restricting their exports to try and keep their own food prices down to the detriment of others, which is further adding to the stress within Asia, she added. Alexander Ponting, an English teacher who moved to Seoul last year, is thankful that things like public transport and coffee are so cheap. But he continues to be shocked by food prices in Seoul, which was ranked as the 10th most expensive city to live in. ""Fruit and vegetables are insanely expensive,"" Mr Ponting said. ""In the UK, a bag of spinach will be like 70 pence ($1.22) or something but here it will cost you three pounds ($5.26)."" Apples are around one pound for a bag in the UK and in Seoul he can pay up to six or seven pounds. In the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, fruit and vegetable prices are nearly doubling. ""The food in Israel is based on vegetables so it's pretty dramatic,"" Tel Aviv resident Ronnie Brodetzky told the ABC. Lettuce used to be four shekels ($1.6) and now it's seven shekels, she said. ""Tomatoes became between 10 to 12 shekels when normally they were four to six. Everything is much more expensive."" Tel Aviv was ranked as number six on ECA's list, while a recent study by the Economist Intelligence Unit named Tel Aviv as the world's most expensive city. Ms Brodetzky said the increasing cost of living is becoming a daily topic of conversation. ""I'm feeling a lot of tension, everyone in Israel is,"" she said. ""No-one knows what is going to happen with so much chaos in the world."" Rents have increased 10-14 per cent since COVID, and even activities like going to the swimming pool costs up to 80 shekels when it used to be between 20 and 40. ""When I was a kid, everything was cheap and normal. You wouldn't need to be rich to be able to enjoy your life,"" the 38-year-old said. ""Nowadays, even if you are middle class and have a good salary like me it's not enough. You need to be really rich."" The US has been dominating headlines as it tries to control an inflation rate that has reached a 40-year high. It's not an exaggeration to say millions of Australian households are needing to foot hundreds of extra dollars a week to keep a roof over their head, the lights on and food on the table — and wages aren't keeping up. Last week, the Federal Reserve rolled out its biggest rate hike since 1994 and there are fears the world's largest economy will slip into a recession. But in New York, which was ranked number two on the ECA list, many locals have become desensitised to high costs of living. Beata Kanter said prices have been increasing by ""a dollar here and there"". ""It's more these little incremental increases that probably go unnoticed in day-to-day life,"" she told the ABC. ""New York is already so expensive, so I've been used to spending $US8 ($11.50) on an iced coffee for a long time now."" Mark Dessaix, a New York-based actor from Sydney, hadn't noticed any ""major leaps and bounds"" until recently. The 40-year-old went to buy apples and the cost had doubled. ""In this grocery shop it was $US9 for four apples when it's usually $US4,"" he said. While everyday price increases are not something he is too concerned about, surging rents may impact Mr Dessiax's plans to move into his own apartment next year. ""I pay per month to live with three other people what I was paying to live by myself in Potts Point [in Sydney],"" he said. ""The average to live alone in a studio or one bedroom apartment here is around $US1,600 to $US1,700 a month (around $2,300-$2,440)."" A number of factors will determine how long it will take for inflation to ease, but the conflict in Ukraine plays a major role. ""Because Russia's invasion has driven that change in energy and food costs quite substantially, if that situation deteriorates then inflation will get worse across the globe,"" Ms Ell said. ""Our expectation at the moment would be that inflation will peak around the second or third quarter of this year, and then will gradually come down."" She predicts inflation to be above a rate that central banks are comfortable with through 2023. ""Because of that, we will continue to see central banks lifting rates and borrowing costs remaining elevated.""

72,"One of these links was a scam. Clicking the wrong one cost Helen $30,000",business,"  In the 25 years Helen Cahill has kept the books for her small business near Melbourne Airport, she's never had any trouble doing online banking. So on a particularly busy afternoon on May 26, when she sat down at her desk, she thought it was strange it was taking so long to log in. She'd googled ""Bendigo Bank"" and clicked on the first link that came up, which was a Google ad for the bank. She then keyed in her login details, including a two-factor authentication pin. What Ms Cahill soon discovered was that she had clicked on a malicious advertisement instead of the Bendigo Bank website, and that a scammer had gained access to her account. ""It was probably within two minutes that I logged onto the genuine Bendigo Bank … and realised that $30,000 had been taken from my account,"" Ms Cahill told 7.30. ""I just felt really violated … I thought, 'How can that happen?' I really feel like I'm a very cautious, careful person when I'm doing banking."" Ms Cahill quickly phoned the bank to report the incident, and also spoke to the IT company that looks after her business' computers, called Ignite Systems. They were able to go back through the steps Ms Cahill took and uncovered that the link she clicked on the search results page looked real, but the site that opened had a phoney URL that was easy to miss in a hurry, referring to ""bendigohank"" instead of ""bendigobank"". ""It looked like a replica of the genuine Bendigo Bank website,"" Ms Cahill said. ""My takeaway message would be: This can happen to anyone."" After days of constant calls and follow-ups on Ms Cahill's part, Bendigo Bank was able to return the funds within a week. But she remains concerned a malicious site was promoted on Google without the bank warning customers of its existence. ""Initially I was very annoyed and then I became very angry that a genuine Google ad could be linked to a bogus online banking site. ""I just do not understand how … the bank didn't know about it. I think something needs to happen with Google, that they can run these ads."" Bendigo Bank said in a statement that after the ad was discovered its ""Financial Crimes team alerted the owner of the platform and had the fraudulent advertisement taken down"". Cyber-security expert Dave Lacey told 7.30 Google ad scams were particularly sophisticated. ""They're using third-party, what we call, ad affiliates that have an ability to almost manipulate or change ads after they've gone through a vetting process,"" Mr Lacey said. Google didn't explain how the scam ad showed up in its search engine. The tech giant said in the last year alone it blocked or removed nearly 60 million ads globally for violating financial services policies, and said it was constantly developing new tools to protect its users from fraudsters. Do you know more about this story? Email 7.30 at 7.30@abc.net.au There have been more than 35,000 reported attempts to gain the personal information of Australians since January. The Australian Cybersecurity Centre reported cybercrime cost the economy an estimated $33 billion in 2021. National identity and cyber-support service IDCARE has never been busier, according to its managing director, Mr Lacey. ""I don't think there are many crimes that you can say penetrate the family home almost on a daily basis,"" he said. ""[Scammers'] whole business is about deception and they're well trained and versed at it."" A popular method used by scammers is what's known as ""phishing"", where things like an email imitating a bank or telco are used to encourage people to share their personal information. ""Smishing"" is a similar method, involving text messages. ""So smishing is via SMS and phishing more generally is via email or telephone,"" Mr Lacey said. One of the leaders of a group involved in a prolific scam operation was jailed in May after duping dozens of Australians when large swathes of the population were in COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. Court documents reveal the group created false identities on a website they called the ""1-stop-rort-shop"", bragging online about software that was able to evade SMS spam filters. Self-promoting videos of their exploits, which were seized by police as part of the operation, showed special logos and wads of cash accompanied by menacing music. ""In this particular case, we would say the offenders were fairly skilled,"" Acting Assistant Commissioner for Cyber Command Chris Goldsmid told 7.30. ""We estimate they sent over 20 million text messages … That's a significant number of people that could have potentially had their information stolen and their bank accounts accessed."" The ""rort corp"" motto was ""what is yours is ours also"". Police found the men had access to staggering amounts of personal information, including people's secret online questions and answers. In one instance, a member of the group bragged about sending ""13 sets"" of personal and financial information, specifically bank account user numbers, account passwords, full names, credit cards, expiry dates and CCV numbers. The syndicate had dozens of identities on tap and Medicare card templates. ""It is difficult for law enforcement and agencies to apply traditional tools of deterrence and intervention,"" Mr Lacey said. ""Certainly, when arrests occur, we do cherish and relish that."" The newly elected Labor government has vowed to crack down on cybercrime, including by introducing new industry codes for banks and telcos. There is a strong emphasis from experts on preventing the crime in the first place and acting quickly when people's accounts are compromised. ""If you think you've been the victim of a scam, don't be embarrassed. Get in contact with your bank,"" Acting Assistant Commissioner Goldsmid said. ""The earlier you report it, the more chance there is … to get that money back."" Watch this story tonight on 7.30 on ABC TV and ABC iview.

73,Coal mine fined for 'unacceptable' damage to world-renowned NSW rock formations,business,"  Coal mine fined for 'unacceptable' damage to world-renowned NSW rock formations An Australian coal mining giant has been fined for damaging sandstone formations, some estimated to be millions of years old, in a New South Wales conservation area. A NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (DPIE) investigation found Centennial Coal's Mount Airly operation, north-west of Lithgow, caused fractures to internationally renowned pagoda rock formations. ""Following an investigation by our compliance officers, we have determined the breaches are unacceptable,"" a DPIE spokesperson said. But there were fears the destruction in the Mugii Murrum-Ban State Conservation Area (SCA) could be worse than currently understood and the full extent of the damage would take years to uncover. An independent review, conducted on Centennial Coal's behalf, found 15 surface cracks related to mining activity in the most western corner of the Gardens of Stone. Of those reported to the DPIE, the biggest was 250 metres long. The damage was caused by land below the rock formations caving in. The company must now carry out remediation work, which includes filling some of the cracks. But Blue Mountain Conservation Society member Yuri Bolotin said that would almost certainly fail. ""Once they're undermined they will eventually collapse even with the best intentions, which I don't think they [Centennial Coal] have,"" he said. ""The damage to pagodas is completely irreversible."" He said the stone towers did not occur anywhere else in the world, dating them between six million and 10 million years old. The mine sits about 300 metres below the surface. Subsidence (ground movement) has exceeded 700 millimetres in some sections, more than five times the allowed limit of 125mm. The company's Environmental Impact Statement had stated surface cracking was not expected from its panel and pillar mining techniques. Centennial Coal acknowledged there may be more cracks that have not yet been identified. DPIE found the company breached its consent obligations and fined it $150,000 for the offences. The money will go towards NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service's conservation work in the area. ""The company will also be required to continually monitor and remediate any future cracks identified over the life of the mine,"" the DPIE spokesperson said. Capertee Valley resident Mary Thirlwall described the damage as an ""extraordinary travesty"". ""Basically they get a slap on the wrist for having caused this amount of damage over one of the most iconic areas,"" she said. ""Unfortunately these impacts often aren't realised for years down the track."" Ms Thirlwall considered the fine to be petty cash for a mining giant. ""It's just saying, ""Carry on"" basically and they've got to because Mount Piper [a coal-fired power station] needs coal,"" she said. An expansion was approved in December last year enabling Centennial Coal to mine up to 1.8 million tonnes of coal a year until 2037. Centennial Coal has since reviewed its mine design to develop wider pillars in an attempt to keep subsidence at allowed levels. A company spokesperson said it had ""implemented changes to achieve its performance criteria"". It has begun mining underneath the adjacent Mount Genowlan, but both Ms Thirwall and Mr Bolotin warned it was even more vulnerable than Mount Airly. The damage has raised concerns about the NSW government's plans to turn the Gardens of Stone SCA into an eco-tourism playground for 200,000 visitors a year. Chris Jonkers, from the Lithgow Environment Group, said around 120 cliff collapses had been recorded in the Lithgow region, almost all of which were above areas that had previously been mined. He most recently observed one near Angus Place Colliery, which was mined from 1979 to 1980, and was owned by the NSW government at the time. ""Cliffs can continue to fall for decades afterwards,"" Mr Jonkers said. ""It's not the sort of place you want to bring thousands of visitors — into unstable areas."" A NSW National Parks and Wildlife spokesperson said all infrastructure proposals were subject to rigorous assessment and designs would consider fragile areas. Deputy Premier Paul Toole said there were areas that ""we won't have people going into"".

74,"Donna remembers the day South Bank opened. And she's still working there 30 years later, stripey uniform and all",business,"  Brisbane's South Bank celebrates 30 years since its opening. And Donna Smith has been working there the whole time 1992. Wayne Goss was the premier. Jim Soorley was the lord mayor. Interest rates were falling. Billy Ray Cyrus's Achy Breaky Heart was topping the Australian charts. And at the South Bank Parklands, you could ride a boat. When it opened 30 years ago this week, thousands of balloons were released, colouring the sky above an excited crowd, in what an ABC News report at the time described as the biggest celebration since Expo 88. Donna Smith was there. She was 16 and working in her father's lolly shop, which opened at South Bank the same day. ""I remember it being extremely busy. And lots and lots of people coming in and out of the store and even lining up to get in. It was crazy,"" Ms Smith said. Three decades on, Ms Smith now owns and runs the business with her husband. They have kept things pretty much the same – even the striped uniform. ""We've done very minimal renovations to keep that magic alive. ""[People who visited as children] come in now and it still looks the same and they can't believe it's still here."" However, much has changed. Gone is the butterfly house and a tourist attraction called Gondwana Land in the original precinct. ""You'd pay an entry fee to go in and walk along the boardwalk. And there'd be all these different spots where you'd see a crocodile. And there'd be all sorts of native animals,"" Ms Smith said. As well as the man-made beach, there was an artificial canal, complete with boats. ""You could hop on it on one end and you could ride the boat right down to the other end of the parkland,"" she said. Research librarian Christina Ealing-Godbold, from the State Library of Queensland, said it felt like a theme park. ""I don't know why they decided to take it away, it could have been expense,"" Ms Ealing-Godbold said. ""But I do know there was a distinct feeling among Brisbane people these were very kitsch elements."" As part of a redevelopment from 1997 to 2001, the boat canal was replaced with a 1-kilometre-long bougainvillea lined arbour. Initially, people were up in arms about the arbour. ""Without the bougainvillea growing all over it, it looked quite weird. This strange metal structure being put through this parkland in the middle of our city,"" Ms Smith said. ""It's just incredible that there were so many people that didn't like the beginning, but now it's just incredible. ""I'm sure there's photos of people standing under it all over the world."" Following World Expo 88, the site was cleared, except for three heritage buildings. The Queensland government planned to sell the 17-hectare precinct for commercial development, according to the South Bank Corporation's website. ""There was some fear of that. How well-founded it was I'm not sure,"" Ms Ealing-Godbold said. In a 1988 newspaper article, then lord mayor Sallyanne Atkinson was quoted as saying the precinct could be used for ""prestigious apartments, showrooms, offices, public and private housing and entertainment along the river bank"". While she also told the paper the site should feature a ""continuous park network"", there were concerns about the space ending up in private hands. ""Brisbane people had so much loved having the expo site as a public space,"" Ms Ealing-Godbold said. ""I don't think they really wanted to see it go back to prestigious apartments. ""I think people were really frightened it might return to an industrial wasteland or an apartment slumland. They didn't want to lose it after it was used so wonderfully as a public place."" The late Sir Llew Edwards, a deputy premier in the Bjelke-Petersen Government and the Expo Authority chairman, outlined plans for a rainforest, concert areas and sculpture park to ""recapture the atmosphere of Expo"". In 1989, the government set up the South Bank Corporation to develop and manage the area. The South Bank Corporation's website says 6.3 million people visited in its first year. The renewal continued with the construction of the Queensland Conservatorium of Music, Griffith University, the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre, as well as apartments and a hotel. Over the years, the parklands have endured natural and economic disaster. ""COVID stopped a lot of tourists,"" Ms Smith said. Major clean ups were needed after the 2011 and 2022 floods. ""A lot of the businesses are only just recovering from flood damage. ""[A whole strip] had no electricity for quite a while. ""The car park, of course, that got inundated again. ""We've certainly seen a lot of ups and downs. We've all been through a lot together at South Bank."" We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. South Bank's transformation continues, with the Neville Bonner Bridge now reaching halfway across the river. The pedestrian bridge will connect the parklands to the Queens Wharf development and is due to open in the first half of 2023. A new theatre is also under construction on Grey Street, at the eastern end of the Queensland Performing Arts Centre. It will have at least 1,500 seats and is scheduled to be finished by the end of the year. South Bank said the food precinct is being refurbished but tenancies are yet to be announced.

75,"'The proof is in the pudding': Buy now, pay later companies hit by perfect storm as laws loom, interest rates and bad debts",business,"  Buy now, pay later companies on the brink as bad debts and interest rates rise Buy now, pay later products such as Afterpay and Zip have become a popular payment method, but the sector is facing a perfect storm of rising interest rates, bad debts, a crowded marketplace and looming regulation. For businesses such as Daniel McCarthy's butcher shop in regional Victoria, offering customers the option to use a buy now, pay later (BNPL) service has resulted in sales growth. ""It has been pivotal for our online business,"" Mr McCarthy said. The payment method is used for about 60 per cent of online sales at his business, and customers are also using it at the shop. His customers who use it also spend more — an average of $140, compared to $30 using other payment types in store. ""People can buy a bulk pack and not actually shell out their money for it,"" he said. ""They can put it on a payment plan, and it just works with their budgets."" Buy now, pay later companies effectively buy a customer's debt in exchange for a merchant fee. The customer makes repayments to the BNPL company in instalments and the service is interest-free. Fees apply if repayments are missed and some companies also charge other account fees. However, while BNPL has been great for many retailers, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, some say the glory days are over for the sector. Start-ups — including Afterpay and Zip — once dominated the scene, but traditional banks such as CBA, Suncorp and NAB, along with Apple, are muscling in. ""You've seen a land grab where these businesses are spending a lot of money on sales and marketing to acquire new customers,"" UBS analyst Tom Beadle said. ""Those customers aren't necessarily good customers. ""In fact, you could almost argue that they self-select poor-quality customers. So what these businesses need to do is sort of focus on keeping those good customers that repay and obviously weeding out those [who] don't."" Zip Co's bad debt and expected losses quadrupled to $148.3 million in the six months to December, 2021, compared to the corresponding period for the previous year, according to the company's latest half-year results. Afterpay's expected credit loss was up 50 per cent, to $151.112 million, in the six months to December 31, according to the company's latest update to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr Beadle said bad debts were rising because of pressure on household budgets. ""And with those bad debts rising, it then creates a circular effect because the buy, now pay later companies then tighten their lending standards,"" he said. ""So that then slows top-line growth further."" Bad debts as a percentage of Afterpay's outstanding consumer loans sit at 13.9 per cent, according to analysis by payments consultant Grant Halverson covering the 2021 calendar year. Zip's percentage sits at 9.7 per cent, followed by non-ASX-listed major players Klarna's (8.5 per cent) and Affirm's (6.5 per cent). In comparison, the Commonwealth Bank's arrears at 90 days for credit cards for the same period were 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent for personal loans, according to the data. Mr Halverson expects CBA's write-off rate at 180 days to be about half that. Australia's corporate watchdog says one in five consumers using buy now, pay later are missing payments. Inflation and rising interest rates are also hitting the sector hard in other ways, prompting mass job lay-offs in the industry. Market analyst Roger Montgomery has been a long-time critic of the sector and maintains it is a bad investment. ""As interest rates rise, in response to rising inflation, then of course what happens is your costs go up,"" Mr Montgomery said. ""So, the margin that you make on your book of loans declines and, at the same time, consumers spend less, so your revenue line is actually coming down. ""I call them profitless prosperity stocks."" Buy now, pay later stocks have tumbled in response to the many problems the sector is facing. On the Australian Stock Exchange, Afterpay is down 50 per cent from $176 to $84.33 since it merged with US pay giant Square at the start of the year. Afterpay's Anthony Eisen and Nick Molnar have taken the group from zero to $39 billion in just six years. ""In my view, I think Afterpay would be lucky to be trading at $20 today if it were a standalone business,"" Mr Beadle said. Latitude and Humm's merger was abandoned as the companies' stocks sunk, down 40 per cent and 45 per cent respectively from a year ago. Zip Co's stocks plummeted 93 per cent, down from $8.21 to 53 cents in a year. It is planning to buy Sezzle, which has tumbled 96 per cent, from $8.24 to 30 cents. Despite Zip Co's share price falling off a cliff, Zip Co's chief operating officer, Peter Gray, is optimistic. ""Reports of our demise are greatly exaggerated,"" Mr Gray told ABC News. ""In March, we did take proactive steps to reduce our global-cost footprint. And we'll see the benefits of those in the [2023 financial year] as we accelerate our path to profitability."" Mr Montgomery said the end of cheap money meant some BNPL players would not survive. ""Some of these businesses will disappear and we'll never see them again,"" he said. ""That's a fact in this environment. There'll be no more funding for them."" The BNPL sector has so far managed to avoid regulation because its providers do not technically charge interest and there is a loophole in the National Credit Code. Some BNPL companies have signed up to a voluntary code of practice, which consumer advocates argue does not contain enough protections. Financial Services Minister Stephen Jones said that was about to change. ""[I'm] not interested in having an argument about whether or not this is credit. It clearly is,"" he said. ""Irrespective of how it's structured, it's credit."" Details of how BNPL products would be regulated would be worked out after consulting with the industry and consumer advocates, he said. Mr Jones said it could start with legislating the industry's code of practice and a strategic review to find out what the gaps were. 'We will ensure that by now, pay later is regulated as a form of credit,"" Mr Jones said. ""That doesn't mean that every single term of the national consumer credit legislation applies in exactly the same way. It won't. But it will be brought within the rubric of the National Consumer Credit Act."" He has pledged to get the legislation before parliament within 12 months. ""I don't want us having this conversation next year,"" Mr Jones said. Companies can just self-regulate, according to a Senate inquiry into fintech. The looming regulation of BNPL globally is another knock to the sector. Mr Gray said Zip remained supportive of fit-for-purpose regulation. ""The minister has suggested that the first steps would be legislation of the industry code, and it would sit as a component of the national credit act, rather than be subject to all the components of the act,"" Mr Gray said. ""We do believe that our services are credit [but] they don't need the same sort of regulation as might govern a mortgage. ""And, of course, we've seen that regulation of the banking sector does not necessarily deliver better outcomes. It's more about the product construct and the intent of the providers."" Consumer advocates — such as chief executive of the Financial Rights Legal Centre Karen Cox — said there was no reason for BNPL products not to be subject to the same rules as other forms of credit. ""The proof is in the pudding,"" Ms Cox said. ""There are so many people who are coming to us who have gotten in over their heads, and they've often gotten in very, very quickly."" ""So, whatever checks they are doing, it is not the same as doing proper, responsible lending checks as required under the credit law."" Michael Fredericks is the managing director and founder of FuPay, which offers a budgeting service along with BNPL and cash-advance products. He said the voluntary code did not provide enough consumer protections and he supported BNPL being regulated under the National Credit Code as it stands. Mr Fredericks said regulation would also allow BNPL players to extend repayment time frames that were shorter and, therefore, exempt them from credit laws. ""Some people struggle to make repayments within that time frame,"" he said. ""It's only really appropriate for a small amount of money, that [is] under the $200 mark. ""We think the balance is to have greater flexibility beyond that, which means you've got to be regulated but not to have open-ended credit … staying away from that debt trap or, we think, the bad credit model of credit cards."" Mr Fredericks said FuPay does not publish the percentage of bad debt from its sales because it was not a listed company. ""It's in the single digits, and it is declining,"" he said.

76,Imran Khan is rallying support for a return to the Pakistani prime ministership,business,"  Imran Khan wants rule of law and an Islamic welfare state in Pakistan Pakistan's ousted prime minister, Imran Khan says the people of Pakistan believe even a poor democracy would be better than a military government. He spoke with ABC's India Now! Host Marc Fennell as he continues to rally grassroots support to demand new elections. Protests have continued in Pakistan among supporters of the deposed prime minister, as the country also faces the serious challenges of rising inflation as well as soaring fuel and food prices. Mr Khan was ousted as prime minister on April 10 following a no-confidence vote. He's since alleged this was part of a conspiracy, pushed by the United States administration because it was unhappy with his foreign policy decisions. Yet there were claims that he'd lost crucial military support. Since then, he's campaigned publicly to be returned to the Prime Minister's Office in Pakistan. ""I think there's consensus in the country that even a poor democratic government is better than a military government,"" Mr Khan told India Now! ""Because, when the military intervention takes place, we go back to square one."" ""So that's why our democracy has not flourished as yet, our democratic institutions haven't got stronger, because we go back to square one when the military takes over."" Elected in July, 2018, Mr Khan promised to fight corruption and fix the economy. He maintains his government was balancing rising prices and economic sentiment. However, as the cost of living in Pakistan rose, the opposition parties blamed him and the no-confidence motion followed. His successors claim that the economic woes faced by Pakistan are his legacy. He insisted the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and commodity prices worldwide were being managed, but the regime change sent the markets into meltdown. No prime minister has completed a full term of office in Pakistan. Mr Khan says his departure was different because it didn't occur under the shroud of corruption. He argues that Pakistan has been ruled by the military for most of its history, its importance was enhanced by the threat posed by India, and two families — the Bhutto and Sharif families. ""These two families have been ruling Pakistan for 30 years — now, the parties that were fighting have joined hands and are in government."" Mr Khan was replaced in April by Shehbaz Sharif, the younger brother of three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who was convicted in 2018 of having owned assets beyond his income. ""My government was replaced by a government where 60 per cent of the cabinet is on bail,"" Mr Khan says. ""Rather than having a roadmap to fix the economy, all they're doing is trying to get rid of the corruption cases of billions of rupees."" Mr Khan claims he has evidence that the United States demanded change. He alleges that, on March 7, 2022, US Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, Donald Lu, sent a message to him through Pakistan's ambassador to the US, Asad Majeed Khan: ""If I'm removed, then all will be forgiven."" ""Now there is this American official, threatening our ambassador,"" Mr Khan says. He's asked for an inquiry into his allegations that the US has participated in regime change. ""There is no truth to these allegations,"" a US State Department spokesman said in April after he first made the claim. Mr Khan does not want any foreign interference in Pakistan. ""I don't want any support from foreign governments to get into power,"" Mr Khan says. ""Let the people of Pakistan decide whoever they think is best to rule or govern the country."" When asked this question by the India Now! host, Mr Khan replied: ""Because, Marc, this is insulting for a country of 220 million people that an elected prime minister is removed by this conspiracy."" Mr Khan argued his policies on Afghanistan, Russian and China had upset Washington — he was in Moscow the day Putin's troops crossed the border. He says he was there to negotiate wheat and oil supplies and, while the timing was bad, he didn't know what was about to occur. He's also been dubbed ""Taliban Khan"" for his perceived support for the Taliban. He insists the Taliban are a religious fundamentalist group, not terrorists. ""You know, somehow, we were made to be sort of friendly with Taliban, or sympathetic with them,"" Mr Khan explains. ""People like us are sympathetic with the people of Afghanistan and, right now, you have Taliban as a reality. ""The world should work with them, because there is no other reality in Afghanistan now."" On an episode of India Now!, that country's High Commissioner to Australia, Manpreet Vohra, said relations between India and Pakistan were strained because of Pakistan's support for terror organisations in the region. Mr Khan rejects this and says Kashmir is the sticking point in the relationship — that is, he says, the denial of the Indian government for the Kashmiri people to determine their own future. ""India blames every incident that takes place in Kashmir on Pakistan,"" he explains. ""The answer is not blaming Pakistan. The answer is to give the people of Kashmir the right to decide their own future."" Imran Khan maintains the rule of law and an Islamic welfare state are the future of Pakistan he'd like to see. ""When I first went to England as a teenager, the two things that inspired me were the rule of law, and a welfare state,"" he says. ""When I studied my own history, the first welfare state in the history of mankind was made by The Prophet Muhammad … this is what I want.""

77,NSW Premier goes ahead with stamp duty reform as first home buyers allowed to opt out,business,"  NSW Premier goes ahead with stamp duty reform as first home buyers allowed to opt out NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet is embarking on his long-touted stamp duty reform, by offering some first home buyers the choice of making the up-front payment or opting into an annual property tax. The choice will be made available to first-time buyers purchasing a home up to the value of $1.5 million and will be announced during today's state budget. If buyers decide to opt out of paying stamp duty, they will pay $400 plus 0.3 per cent of the land value per year. Mr Perrottet has argued that stamp duty was an impediment for young people to getting into the market. ""We want to lower the barriers to owning a home for first home buyers seeking a place of their own,"" Mr Perrottet said. ""Lifting home ownership is part of this government's efforts and ambition to help families who are feeling the squeeze."" If a buyer decides to pay the annual property tax, that property is not locked into the scheme when it is sold. As interest rates rise, Sydney house prices are dropping and experts say it is a ""bellwether"" for what is about to happen across the rest of the country. The state government has allocated $728 million in today's state budget over the next four years, as part of its housing affordability package, to cover the shortfall of revenue. ""It will mean more NSW residents will get into their first home at an earlier age and achieve the great Australian dream of home ownership,"" NSW Treasurer Matt Kean said. The stamp duty announcement falls short of the reform Mr Perrottet has been pushing since he was treasurer. He wanted 80 per cent of homes across the state to have the option of paying an annual land tax, and buyers would be eligible regardless of whether they were purchasing their first home. But the Premier has previously conceded such large-scale reform couldn't be achieved without the help of the Commonwealth because of the loss of government revenue which is estimated to be about $2.5 billion per year. Mr Perrottet has blamed the past Coalition government for failing to support the reform, while the new Labor government has flagged a willingness to tackle housing affordability. NSW Labor has stated its opposition to the move from stamp duty to a land tax. ""Dominic Perrottet has no mandate to charge families an annual land tax on their family home that will last forever,"" Shadow Treasurer Daniel Mookhey said yesterday. The state government plans to introduce legislation later this year, so that the new first home buyer scheme can start from January 16, 2023. The current stamp duty exemption for properties purchased by first home buyers that are less than $650,000 will remain in place. The stamp duty for first home buyers purchasing properties between $650,000 and $800,000 will continue to be reduced. The government says 55,000 people a year should be able to benefit from its first home buyers schemes.

78,Fracking fight over gas exploration reaches the Supreme Court,business,"  NT pastoralist takes Sweetpea Petroleum to Supreme Court over fracking exploration access agreement A cattle station owner trying to stop a gas company from fracking on his property has taken his fight to the Supreme Court. A tribunal granted gas company Sweetpea Petroleum the right to access Tanumbirini Station despite the owner's opposition The pastoralist's lawyers argue the move interferes with the cattle station's operations The case is the first test of new NT land access laws passed in 2020 Gas company Sweetpea Petroleum began preparatory works for fracking at Tanumbirini Station in the gas-rich Beetaloo Basin last month. Stretching across an area more than twice the size of Tasmania, the basin - 400 kilometres south of Darwin - contains enough shale gas to power Australia for an estimated 200 years. A two-day hearing began in Darwin on Monday morning, with lawyers appealing a decision which allowed fracking exploration to go ahead. The decision was made by the NT Civil and Administrative Tribunal in May, which granted Sweetpea an access agreement to begin exploration work on the cattle station, owned by Rallen Australia. It allowed Sweetpea to cut a fence at Tanumbirini Station and move machinery onto two paddocks at the property, despite the opposition of the cattle station owners. Rallen Australia will receive a minimum of $15,000 compensation per gas well drilled on the property as a part of the agreement. Tanumbirini station owner and Rallen Australia Director Pierre Langenhoven said Sweetpea had shown ""flagrant disrespect"" undertaking exploration work in the face of his company's opposition. ""Its operations are already causing havoc,"" Mr Langenhoven said. ""They have cut our fences, bulldozed access routes and flaunted their own plans for protecting our stock and managing weeds."" The chief executive of Sweetpea's parent company, Tamboran Resources, said the company was working within the approved terms of the access agreement and had worked closely with all stakeholders. ""Pastoral lease and exploration lease holders are granted overlapping tenures by the Northern Territory,"" Joel Riddle said. ""These lease holders have come to agreements across the Northern Territory and Australia successfully over many decades to manage their dual rights over public land and will continue to do so to the mutual benefit of industry, traditional owners and the environment."" Lawyers for the cattle station owner said the case would be a test of new land access laws, passed in 2020, to try to balance the interests of the pastoral and gas industries. A gas company has accessed a Northern Territory cattle station to begin exploration, against the wishes of pastoralists and some traditional owners. The laws gave the tribunal power to impose access arrangements if negotiating parties could not reach an agreement. ""We have some serious concerns about the adequacy of the agreement and so the appeal to this court is testing the new process,"" lawyer Kathy Merrick said. The lawyers are arguing the access agreement imposes lesser standards on Sweetpea than the standard minimum protections required under Northern Territory law, and fails to balance the interests of the cattle station and gas company. ""The petroleum industries argue that they have entitlements, but their entitlements are to minerals under the earth and my client's entitlements are to operate a business without interruption on the surface,"" Ms Merrick said. ""To have an explorer argue that cutting the surface of the land up to get access to the assets below doesn't result in the interference is something that we struggle with."" Tamboran Resources' chief executive Joel Riddle said there was a need to balance the rights of competing interests. ""Rallen's purchase of pastoral leases took place after the gas moratorium in the Northern Territory was lifted, knowing full well of the Northern Territory Government's desire to develop the Beetaloo Basin,"" he said. Mr Langenhoven said he was concerned about the long-term viability of the cattle station if the access agreement was upheld. ""I don't have an issue with them sharing the land, but I've got an issue with them dictating how we can use the land,"" he said. ""It's different if they come and consult us and actually understand our business, understand what it takes to run a cattle business, and sit down and make plans how we can do it together. ""But to date, it's their way or no way. ""There won't be room for both on the properties, I just feel that the cattle industry will be sacrificed for the gas industry.""

79,Gondwana-era rainforest walk to draw ecotourists to Dorrigo National Park in $56-million investment ,business,"  Dorrigo National Park investment to rival 'the Daintree' with $56 million Gondwana-era walk A four-day walking track featuring three suspension bridges over World Heritage-listed rainforest is set to put the New South Wales town of Dorrigo on the bucket list for ecotourists. Bellingen Shire Council Mayor Steve Allan said the entire Mid North Coast region had been buzzing since the state government announced the $56.4-million investment. It will include a 46-kilometre walking track, as well as walker's hut precincts, new camping areas, three suspension bridges and a new Arc Rainforest Centre. ""This is such a huge opportunity for Dorrigo and Bellingen Shire,"" Mr Allan said. ""It will not just create over 250 jobs, but will bring people from all over the world to visit our world class site. ""It's certainly going to put Dorrigo on the map."" National Parks and Wildlife Service Coffs Coast area manager Glenn Storrie said the project would be an opportunity for tourists to take a step back in time to the Jurassic period. ""Gondwana rainforest goes back to the time when we were part of this supercontinent,"" he said. ""We have living fossils that are part of this rainforest, massive trees, teeming waterfalls and so much wildlife. ""The experience will be like a moment back in time."" NSW National Parks injects $18 billion into the state economy annually, with 75 per cent of that economic benefit generated from regional areas. The state government hoped the project would attract an extra 200,000 domestic and international visitors to the region. ""We really wanted to create places where you can experience the rainforest, smell the cool mountain air and hear the birds,"" Mr Storrie said. ""It's vital for our mental wellbeing and we wanted to reflect that."" NSW Environment Minister James Griffin said the project was part of the largest ever capital investment program in the state's national parks. ""The rainforest at Dorrigo National Park is even more spectacular than the Daintree,"" he said. ""We'll be happily tempting domestic and international tourists away from Queensland."" The walk and new rainforest centre will also incorporate connection and education about the culture of the traditional custodians of the rainforests, the Gumbaynggirr people.

80,Recovery a step closer after savage storms cripples tourism and railway line in western Victoria ,business,"  Daylesford, Creswick tourism operators working to reopen storm-damaged Victorian businesses Key tourism businesses damaged by major storms in western Victoria during January have taken big steps towards reopening, with expectations it will help meet high visitor demand. Creswick's RACV Goldfields Resort will reopen to the public this week after a near six-month closure following flooding on January 5. Meanwhile, work is underway to clear more than 800 trees from the Daylesford Spa Country Railway between Musk and Bullarto, which has been closed since June 2021 storms. Daylesford Macedon Tourism chief executive Steve Wroe said visitation numbers were high after a strong COVID-19 bounce-back, but the region's operators were struggling to keep up due to labour shortages. ""The key impediment to business at the moment is people can't get enough staff,"" he said. ""Restaurants are opening at reduced capacity. ""Some places aren't open on a long weekend, for example, and that is not ideal but it is completely understandable."" Mr Wroe said the return of large tourism businesses like the RACV Goldfields Resort would fill a gap in the town's accommodation availability. ""Creswick really is a town that relies on that accommodation provider to serve other tourism businesses,"" he said. The resort and golf course will reopen on Thursday following the completion of extensive repairs to flooding and storm damage. Two floors needed a complete rebuild and two other floors were significantly damaged. Completed works include an upgraded lobby and new gym equipment, carpet, curtains, furniture and children's entertainment facilities. RACV Goldfields Resort Manager Martin Zumstein said its new Arthouse, a multi-purpose arts-focused building, would add to tourism offerings in Creswick. He said resort staff were ""really excited to get back and open"". ""We really prioritised as best as we could to be open for school holidays,"" Mr Zumstein said. ""The resort plays a significant role in contributing to the local economy. ""On a normal year we bring in between 50,000 to 55,000 guests through the property."" He said the resort was the largest accommodation provider in the region. ""It is also one of the largest conference resorts in western Victoria,"" Mr Zumstein said. ""We understand and respect the role we have for the community in trying to bring tourism to the region. That was a real push for us to try to get open."" Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Ballarat's weekly email newsletter. Daylesford Spa Country Railway was hoping to reopen its entire line to the public by the end of the year. Vice president Steven Fiume said volunteers who run the organisation cleared trees and reopened the railway between Daylesford and Musk after the June 2021 storm. But the closure of the most picturesque section between Musk and Bullarto, which needed work well beyond volunteer capacity, had led to a drop in visitor numbers equating to approximately $180,000 in lost income. Mr Fiume said the railway was a significant tourism drawcard for Daylesford. ""It is one of the largest if not the largest attraction any Sunday,"" he said. ""The market attracts over 200,000 people a year and the railway takes 20 to 30,000 passengers a year,"" he said. ""It is a great way to spend an hour, out on the train through the countryside and back."" Mr Fiume said the closure had also affected partner businesses Passing Clouds winery, which has its own train platform, Winter Sounds festival and weddings at Bullarto Hall. He said storm recovery was a long and frustrating process but volunteers were thankful work had started to reopen the line. ""We would have liked to have been up and running and earning money again six months ago,"" Mr Fiume said. ""But all of these things take time and we are thankful we haven't been forgotten and the clean-up has started.""

81,"Rising fuel prices driving surge in number plate thefts, says SA auto club",business,"  Petrol price rises driving surge in theft of car number plates, RAA believes The theft of a car is hardly something you are likely to overlook — but the theft of number plates is a different matter entirely. At a glance, you might not notice they have gone, especially if they have been replaced by another set. While hundreds of plates are reported stolen each year in South Australia, the Royal Automotive Association said it had noticed a rise over the past 12 months, linking the trend to petrol price rises. ""We've been looking at some of the stats and … we think there's been about a 15 per cent increase in number-plate thefts,"" RAA automotive policy senior manager Mark Borlace told ABC Radio Adelaide. ""The reason they're getting knocked off is because [thieves] want their identity hidden. ""We suspect that the high fuel prices may be causing some of these crimes."" Petrol has become an increasingly valuable commodity in recent months, with the price soaring amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Prices have continued to climb, and unleaded is currently hovering around $2.25 a litre in Adelaide. Mr Borlace said that as fuel thieves targeted petrol stations, covering their plates was one way they could not only cover their tracks, but create a false trail. ""The reality is that number plates are stolen for a couple of reasons, and one of them is petrol drive-offs,"" he said. ""If the stolen plates are put on by a person who's got a large four-wheel-drive [and] they fill up and drive off without paying, that could be a $100 or $200 bill they've left. ""If those number plates are linked to your car, the police are going to look at that number and come back to you."" ABC Radio Adelaide listener Alex said his front number plate was recently stolen from his car parked out the front of his home. But because the plate was switched with another stolen one, he didn't initially notice. ""I didn't realise they were stolen until I drove it into the city and put it into one of those car parks where you then have to put your registration in to pay your fees,"" he said. Making some small changes could help you save money at the bowser – so is there any truth to the myths about the best and worst fuel habits? We asked the experts. ""I looked at the number plates and realised there [was] something strange here. That's when I realised I'd had my plates stolen. ""Eventually I worked out that the number plate that had been replaced on the front of my car belonged to my neighbour, who had their number plates stolen late last year."" Mr Borlace said some drivers had only noticed their plates had been stolen when they received fines for crimes they had not committed. ""You could get a speeding fine in the mail for a vehicle you weren't driving — that may be the first time you know about it,"" he said. ""If they get stolen, there's inconvenience. You can't drive your car without number plates so you've lost use of your car for at least a week."" Mr Borlace said one ambitious solution was retiring number plates altogether and replacing them with digital devices. ""The number plate is pretty old technology — it's a piece of pressed aluminium stuck on the front and rear of the car,"" he said. ""There have been some studies done of having electronic recognition of the vehicle, so similar technology that's used to collect tolls. ""You'd actually have a transponder on your car that would have the effect of a digital number plate."" But, in the meantime, Mr Borlace said motorists could take some lower-tech steps to protect their plates from being pilfered, including by getting ""tamper-proof screws"". ""They're screws with a metal protrusion,"" he said. ""You screw them in and when they get tight the protrusion snaps off and you're just left with a dome.""

82,"Market sell-off a 'real downturn' and risk of global recession close to 50-50, analyst warns",business,"  Market sell-off a 'real downturn' and risk of global recession close to 50-50, analyst warns It may sound a little strange that global markets are going through a meltdown due to fears of a potential recession in the next year or two, particularly given how strongly the economy has been performing. Last week, the ASX 200 fell by 6.6 per cent — its worst fall since the COVID-19 crash of March 2020. The Australian share market is undergoing a correction, having dropped by almost 16 per cent from its record high in August last year. To be classed as a ""bear"" market, it will need to drop at least a further 4 per cent. Meanwhile, on Wall Street, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are deep in bear-market territory, having plummeted by more than 20 and 30 per cent, respectively, from their all-time highs. In recent months, the Reserve Bank, US Federal Reserve and their global counterparts have lifted interest rates aggressively to bring down the cost of living, which has surged by its fastest pace in many decades. They have also removed trillions of dollars in stimulus they had pumped into their COVID-ravaged economies over the past couple of years — a move that has caused their economies to overheat and for bubbles to emerge in the stock, property and cryptocurrency markets. ""This is a real downturn that is happening for real reason,"" nabTrade's head of investment behaviour, Gemma Dale, told ABC News. ""It's not just sentiment. Higher rates mean that you should pay less for equities (shares). ""The companies that you are investing in will probably make less money in the future in this environment. How much less is the big question. ""Any company with a lot of debt is going to perform badly and a higher interest-rate environment,"" Ms Dale said, referring specifically to unprofitable tech and buy now, pay later companies. On the flip side, she is more optimistic about infrastructure and toll-road stocks. ""Any company that can pass on their increased costs directly to the consumer, without any meaningful fall in volume... are really good companies to look at."" The share market is undergoing an increasingly volatile period as there is considerable debate about how rapidly, and by how much, the RBA and its global peers will lift interest rates. However, it is tough for central banks to reach a ""neutral rate"". It is a sweet spot where they are not stimulating the economy, nor are they causing it to slow down. The US Fed, in particular, does not have a great track record when it comes to avoiding economic downturns during their previous rate hiking cycles. The Fed has ""never been able to correct"" even smaller overshoots of inflation and employment ""without pushing the economy into a significant recession"", according to Deutsche Bank, which is forecasting a major recession for the US. ""We remain of the view that a global recession can be avoided,"" AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver said. ""But with central banks now hiking rates aggressively, the risks have increased to the point that it's now close to 50-50. ""Either way, it’s still too early to say that shares have bottomed."" Despite the market falling deeper into a ""correction"" or ""bear-market"" phase, some market experts are warning against ""buying the dip"". There are fears we could be on the verge of another global recession and investors are spooked. During those tough phases in the market, there is often a short-lived recovery, followed by an even bigger sell-off. It is often referred to as a ""dead-cat bounce"" and likened to catching a falling knife. ""I think, for a lot of investors, piling in right now has a fair bit of risk attached to it,"" Ms Dale said. ""And you would want to have a very long time frame if you were looking at markets at this point in time."" ""It's not unusual for people to feel that the worst has happened, and there's no more bad news in the market. They think, 'It's time to buy,' so we see a little bounce. ""Then the next day, everyone thinks, This is serious,' and, 'Oh God, I'm getting out.' And it's not always the same people."" ""So it's not necessarily a sign that we've reached the [market] bottom when you see those massive jumps."" This week, local investors will be paying close attention to the words of RBA governor Philip Lowe to see whether he offers any clues on the size of the next rate hike (July 5). After all, he will give a speech on Tuesday morning titled, Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy. Depending on what he says, it might cause investors to re-assess their bets on how high rates will climb (and by extension, how overvalued their shares will become). On that same morning, the RBA will also publish the minutes of its June meeting, which may shed further light on why it opted for a bigger-than-expected rate hike of 0.5 percentage points. Then on Friday, he will speak at an event in Switzerland, hosted by investment bank UBS, on the topic of central banks and inflation. However, global investors will be more interested in what US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell will say about interest rates this week. Mr Powell is due on Wednesday and Thursday (local time) to give his semi-annual testimony about the state of America's economy to the US Senate's Banking Committee. Dr Oliver expects the Fed chair to ""be hawkish, reiterating the Fed's commitment to continue tightening until there is clear and convincing"" evidence that inflation is falling. ""This is unlikely to reduce market expectations for a rise in the Fed funds rate to 3.5 per cent by year end and to well above 4 per cent by mid next year,"" he said. The Reserve Bank lifted the cash rate to 0.85 per cent earlier this month after announcing a double-sized increase of 0.5 percentage points. The RBA governor also gave a rare interview on 7.30 last week, in which he predicted Australia's inflation rate would hit 7 per cent by the end of this year, and reiterated his desire to see the cash rate lift to 2.5 per cent. The Australian share market will need to fall at least a further 5 per cent from the current 15 per cent to be classed as a ""bear"" market. David Taylor breaks down what happens next. Dr Oliver said the market was expecting Australia's cash rate to rise to ""nearly 4 per cent by year end, and above 4 per cent next year"". He said, in his view, that was ""too hawkish"" and unlikely to happen. ""A rise to 4 per cent for the cash rate would see average discounted variable mortgage rates rise to around 7.5 per cent (from around 3.5 per cent in April),"" he wrote in a note to clients. ""When combined with the surge in fixed mortgage rates (which have already gone from around 2 per cent to around 5 per cent) it would likely cause real problems for consumer spending, [and] a big spike in mortgage stress (as debt interest payments will more than double from earlier this year). He also said it would ""push property prices down by 20 to 30 per cent … which indicates it's unlikely to happen as it would crash the economy and ultimately push inflation back well below the RBA's target [2-3 per cent]"".

83,Police question contractor over alleged sexual assault at Pilbara mine site as FIFO report looms,business,"  Roy Hill mine site alleged sexual assault sparks police probe as WA FIFO harassment report looms Police are investigating an alleged assault at a Pilbara mine site, days before a WA parliamentary inquiry into sexual harassment against women in the resources industry is due to be tabled. A spokesperson for Hancock Prospecting's Roy Hill mine site said the alleged incident involved two contractors, and the accused perpetrator had been removed from the site and was now assisting police with the investigation. The Roy Hill iron ore project is located 115 kilometres north of Newman in WA's north-west. In a statement, the spokesperson said Roy Hill had implemented a range of measures to strengthen safety on the site, including adding more security guards. ""We work hard to provide a respectful and inclusive workplace where every person feels safe and where they are encouraged and supported to speak up,"" they said. ""Any actions contrary to this will not be tolerated."" After media reports exposed the extent of the issue and mining bosses held a media conference to apologise to sexual assault victims, a formal inquiry into the fly-in, fly-out industry began in July 2021. The WA Parliament spent months hearing from survivors of sexual harassment and assault, as well the heads of some of the country's largest mining operators like BHP, Rio Tinto, and Woodside. Over the course of the inquest, it was revealed WA Police had investigated 23 sexual harassment claims at mine sites in two years, 21 of which were allegedly committed against women. Various mining giants have since pledged to rewrite and review their processes and safety policies. The inquiry has been chaired by the opposition's Libby Mettam, who said she was looking forward to the report being made public on Thursday. ""It's the product of 11 months of work of our committee,"" she said. ""I hope that it receives the attention and the urgency that it deserves from industry and government."" She said news of the alleged assault at Roy Hill was ""deeply distressing"". ""I hope the woman involved has all the support that she needs.""

84,Mac Point head Mary Massina to exit despite being cleared of bullying allegation,business,"  Macquarie Point Development Corporation head Mary Massina stands down The woman in charge of a multi-million dollar project to develop Hobart's waterfront has stepped down, less than two weeks after it was revealed the project's operations were subject to a review. Macquarie Point Development Corporation chief executive Mary Massina will leave the organisation on July 16 after five years at the helm. The move was announced by Premier Jeremy Rockliff and State Development Minister Guy Barnett in a press release early Monday. The statement said Ms Massina had advised the State Growth Department Secretary that ""a fresh set of eyes will help take the development through the next phase"". ""The Tasmanian government recognises the very significant contribution Ms Massina has made in leading the Macquarie Point development through the highly challenging planning and remediation stage,"" the statement said. The independent review, commissioned by the corporation's chairman Brian Scullin, follows allegations of staff bullying and inappropriate spending raised in state parliament by independent MP Kristie Johnston. In their press release, Mr Rockliff and Mr Barnett said a separate workplace grievance investigation, understood to relate to bullying allegations, had cleared Ms Massina. The Macquarie Point development has been dogged by concerns over a lack of progress in recent years, despite the tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer funds poured into it. In April, it was revealed that the corporation had spent $700,000 on a bike path — only for half of it to be demolished for remediation works about two years later. The government said it would shortly begin searching for Ms Massina's replacement. Tourism Industry Council of Tasmania chief executive Luke Martin is pushing for an independent review of the entire Macquarie Point strategy and development program to take place before a new chief executive is appointed. Mr Martin said that should include considering the suitability of Macquarie Point for a new stadium. Ms Massina, who was on a package worth $280,000 last year, will finish up with the corporation on July 16.

85,Biogas supply chain emissions found to be higher than fossil fuel equivalent,business," Science Gas might be expensive, but biogas comes with its own hidden cost in methane emissions Compared to fossil fuels including natural gas, biogas — which is made from waste — is a cleaner, greener alternative. The International Energy Agency estimates that biogas (and biomethane) could meet up to 20 per cent of the world's gas requirements during the transition away from fossil fuels, and help us get closer to net zero. But a new study, published in the journal One Earth, claims emissions from biogas could be higher than we've been estimating, and there is significant work to be done to get its emissions down. The researchers looked at data from European biogas producers. They found the rate (not the total volume) of emissions along the biogas supply chain — from production through to supply — was comparable and generally higher than for natural gas, according to lead author Semra Bakkaloglu from the Imperial College London. ""The level of emissions was higher than we thought it would be,"" Dr Bakkaloglu said. ""At present, our results indicate [biogas emissions] are high — higher even than natural gas, which is clearly a worry."" It's important to point out here that even with high emissions along the supply chain, biogas is still the greener alternative to natural gas. That's because biogas is created out of waste that would have otherwise released emissions as it decomposed naturally. However, that's not to say that biogas is always climate neutral. To create biogas, you start with a feedstock, which might be, for instance, cattle manure or food scraps. That's broken down anaerobically by microorganisms. They create mostly methane and some carbon dioxide as by-products, which are captured as gas — but some of it escapes into the atmosphere. Compared to carbon dioxide, which is released during aerobic digestion, methane is a much more potent, albeit shorter-lived, greenhouse gas, according to Peter Ashman, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of Adelaide, who wasn't involved with the research. ""What they're highlighting here is important because if you take CO2 from the atmosphere and you emit it back into the atmosphere as methane, that methane has a much higher potency as a greenhouse gas than CO2,"" Professor Ashman said. Unlike biogas, the International Energy Agency has warned there can be no new coal, oil, or natural gas developments if the world is to reach net zero by 2050. The researchers argue that if we're going to use it as a transition fuel, we need to know biogas emissions for nations to accurately gauge their greenhouse gas footprints. ""If biomethane is to be used to achieve decarbonisation goals in future, biomethane supply chain emissions must be minimised,"" Dr Bakkaloglu said. ""We believe that with the proper design, detection, measurement, and repair techniques, much of the observed emissions can be avoided."" Once the gas is captured during the production of biogas, what's left of the feedstock at the end is what's known as digestate. According to the research, the greatest source of emissions along the biogas supply chain was at the digestate storage stage. The researchers found that methane emissions from digestate were up to 23 per cent higher than had been previously reported. The next highest source of emissions was found to be during the biogas production stage, mostly from the anaerobic digester. Professor Ashman said he wasn't shocked that supply-chain emissions might be higher from European biogas producers, as they lacked the scale and financial backing of most natural gas operators. ""That doesn't surprise me,"" he said. ""Some of these operations are pretty agricultural and they probably don't put much effort into capturing those emissions."" Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. The researchers said there was a silver lining to their work. First of all, they found there were ""super emitters"" — a few operations responsible for the vast majority of escaping methane. In this case, just 5 per cent of biogas producers were responsible for more than 60 per cent of all methane emitted. Dr Bakkaloglu said it was a similar case for the fossil fuel gas industry. ""Biomethane and biogas supply chains exhibit similar emissions characteristics to oil and natural gas, with super emitters present at all stages,"" she said. ""In natural gas supply chains, about 50 per cent of emissions are down to only about 5 per cent of sources."" For biogas, what that means is that targeting those few worst offenders can put a big dent in the overall greenhouse-gas footprint of the industry. And there are some fairly straightforward steps to plugging leaks in the supply chain. ""We do not want to discourage the production and use of biomethane,"" Dr Bakkaloglu said. ""Rather, we want to highlight those emissions and encourage people to take immediate action to tackle them. ""Biomethane is an important renewable source, but it has the potential to be even better."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

86,'Perrottet's captain's pick': Barilaro's US job at centre of parliamentary inquiry,business,"  NSW upper house inquiry to probe John Barilaro's appointment as trade commissioner to US The appointment of former NSW deputy premier John Barilaro as the state's trade commissioner to the US will be investigated by a parliamentary inquiry. His new job as trade commissioner was announced on Friday and is among six trade posts around the world tasked with spruiking the state's investment opportunities and local businesses. Premier Dominic Perrottet said Mr Barilaro's appointment was the result of a ""rigorous talent search"" by a global recruitment firm. Mr Barilaro, who resigned late last year just days after former premier Gladys Berejiklian, played a role in setting up the international trade initiative Global NSW. Opposition Leader Chris Minns said an upper house inquiry would now look into the decision, which he has described as a ""$400,000-a-year job for a friend"". ""This represents everything that's wrong with the NSW Liberals and Nationals after 11 years in government,"" he said on Twitter. ""This is Dominic Perrottet's captain's pick and he will be held accountable."" Penny Sharpe, Labor's leader in the upper house, said the inquiry would leave no stone unturned. ""This stinks to high heaven,"" Ms Sharpe said. ""It just doesn't make any sense that the Premier would decide that John Barilaro is the best person in the whole of NSW to go to New York and represent us on our behalf."" Treasurer Matt Kean today defended the decision-making process regarding the appointment. ""John Barilaro was a trade minister and he appears qualified to be a trade commissioner,"" he said. ""I've been informed that this has gone through the proper process and that's how decisions should be taken."" In accepting his appointment, Mr Barilaro — who recently settled his defamation case against Google — said he would continue to build on what had already been achieved. ""I'm looking forward to supporting NSW companies to export and expand to the United States,"" he said. ""Including the many fintech, cyber security, space, health and food and beverage companies.

87,"Queensland government's social housing plan 'a drop in the ocean' to help 50,000 needing a home",business,"  Queensland's social housing register list the 'size of Gympie's population' as government recycles investment announcement A Queensland government announcement that up to 1,200 new social and affordable homes will be built, will not see any additional homes beyond what has previously been announced. Treasurer Cameron Dick today revealed the homes would be delivered under a partnership struck between the Brisbane Housing Company (BHC) and the Queensland Investment Corporation (QIC). The first seven projects will see almost 600 homes built, with construction set to begin between 2023 and 2025. ""This commercial partnership is a model which has not been seen before in Queensland,"" Mr Dick said in a statement, a day out from handing down the state budget. The deal falls under the government's $1 billion housing investment fund, which was announced as part of last year's budget, and does not involve new additional homes — instead it forms part of the government's existing pledge to build 7,400 new social and affordable homes over the next 4 years. The $1 billion fund was established for its returns to contribute about $160 million in extra funding over the forward estimates to increase supply. ""When applications opened for the $1 billion Housing Investment Fund, we told the market we were seeking proposals which identified new solutions to deliver housing for vulnerable Queenslanders,"" Mr Dick said. ""It will see BHC leverage QIC's strong track record of securing and managing institutional investment to deliver new social and affordable housing."" Opposition Leader David Crisafulli has accused the government of not doing enough to address the housing crisis. ""You can't see our rental vacancy rates and 50,000 Queenslanders on the [social housing] waiting list and not be alarmed,"" he said. ""And for the Treasurer to re-announce something from 12 months ago … that's not looking for a housing solution, it's looking for a political one."" Last month the government announced the first two projects from the investment fund, located at Chermside and Redcliffe. QCOSS CEO Aimee McVeigh told ABC Radio Brisbane that since the $2.9 billion investment was made by the state government last year, it has actually halved the number of houses delivered compared to the year before, and this announcement was a ""drop in the ocean"" to what was needed. ""So yes, this model is fantastic. Yes, we see the need to see more money into the housing investment funds. There is potential for more projects, but this is not a new initiative,"" she said. ""We have 50,000 people — a population around the size of Gympie — on our social housing register, and people are waiting for up to, almost four years for a house. ""Our social housing register has blown out by 80 per cent over the last four years, so 1,200 new homes ... it's a drop in the ocean."" She said there needed to be about 5,000 houses built per year over the next decade to really deal with the crisis. ""Obviously the state government can't fund that alone. It is fantastic that we have a Prime Minister who grew up in public housing, he's living proof of what happens when you put the roof over the head of a child,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, if he was living in Queensland right now as a kid, he'd be more likely to be living in a tent or a hotel room. ""We need our prime minister to use his lived experience and turn that into political will, work with our state government so that both levels of government are not only making significant investment, but that we have accelerated construction."" It ""remains to be seen"" whether the Premier's social housing plan is achievable, Master Builders Queensland CEO Paul Bidwell said, given the limited availability of tradespeople and the cost of materials right now. ""It's a shot in the arm for the commercial sector, so there will be a lot of builders who are keen to get hold of this work,"" he said. ""The question will be what the cost is, and that's something that will need to be worked out between the housing company and the builders, with input from the state government."" We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Executive director of Q Shelter Fiona Caniglia said the state government really needed to organise a housing roundtable or summit to bring all the stakeholders together to collaborate on a solution. ""We're calling on the government to work with our sector, to really identify a target,"" she said. ""We need a target for all housing, to meet population demand. And then within that, we need a target that meets the true demand for social and affordable homes. And we don't have that. ""We really think that there's encouraging signs that our government, local government, and mayors are coming out to try and see more homes come out of the short-term rental market and into the long-term rental market. ""There's also examples of the private sector coming forward to talk about build to rent models at scale, which would be really positive. It's why we think the state government has a critical role in bringing together those different stakeholders to to achieve progress on many fronts.""

88,What is off-peak electricity and how can I benefit from it?,business,"  What is off-peak electricity? What hours are considered off-peak? Am I eligible for off-peak electricity rates? The end of the day is usually when most of us return from work and begin to unwind. But for Australia's energy market, that's when it's experiencing the biggest strain. Between the cost of living, rising electricity prices and talk of potential blackouts, there's been a lot of drama around Australia's power network recently. But did you know you could save energy, and potentially reduce your power bill, by using appliances at odd hours? Here's what you need to know about off-peak electricity. Off-peak refers to lower, discounted electricity prices during specific times. Off-peak times are generally when residential homes and businesses use less electricity. Energy Australia says electricity used in busy peak times can place a strain on Australia's electricity networks. That's why off-peak electricity is charged at a cheaper price, to encourage people to use their electricity outside these busy times. Off-peak electricity can also refer to electricity being used by a stand-alone appliance, like an electric hot water service on a dedicated circuit. This appliance is metered separately and can be billed on off-peak rates, according to Energy Australia. Off-peak times will vary depending on your location and meter type, but for most people it usually means at night or on weekends. Off-peak times can also differ between energy providers. For instance, according to Australian Power and Gas (APG), peak times to use electricity is generally 4pm to 8pm on weekdays. Then there are 'shoulder' times, which sit between peak and off-peak times. APG considers shoulder times to be between: Hours outside of those times are considered off-peak. It's worth checking with your energy provider to find out the exact peak, shoulder and off-peak times for your plan, and which kind of tariff you're on. Being eligible for off-peak electricity prices depends on: Energy Australia has outlined the most common meter types and their eligibility for off peak prices: Meter configuration Eligible for off-peak Time of Use (interval) Time of Use (interval) meters can charge at three prices: peak, off-peak and shoulder Yes Two Rate Two-rate meters are able to charge at two prices: peak and off-peak Yes Single Rate Single-rate meters charge at one single price and can't offer off-peak electricity No Dedicated Circuit Dedicated circuit can charge a dedicated appliance (for example hot water or underfloor heating) on off-peak prices Yes A time-of-use tariff works by charging several different rates based on the time of day energy is consumed. Generally, this means you'll need either a digital or smart meter, the availability of which differs depending on where you live in Australia. However, some basic meters may have the capability to support this tariff, Origin Energy says. You can usually find out which kind of tariff you have by looking at your latest electricity bill, or getting in touch with your provider. In addition to using a time-of-use tariff electricity, many appliances now have timers and delay start features which can help you take advantage of off-peak times.

89,Pole in middle of bikeway 'brings a whole new meaning to a shared pathway',business,"  Stobie pole installed in middle of Bolivar bikeway creates dangerous obstacle for cyclists A power pole has been installed in the middle of a bike path in Adelaide's northern suburbs, sparking safety concerns from cyclists and bemusement from others. SA Power Networks, which put the stobie pole in, says it will fix the path to go around the obstacle this week but only after publicity over the weekend criticising its placement. A cyclist who regularly uses the path along the Little Para River at Bolivar says the pole has been there for three months. Cyclists have to divert either onto gravel or down a riverbank to go around it. ""It's on a sweeping corner with zero lighting,"" cyclist Tom Colls said. ""With longer dark hours in the winter, it can pose a risk to early morning and later cycling commuters that don't have expensive high-lumens forward lighting. ""On top of that, the loose gravel used to traverse around it can be mushy and slippery under wet conditions."" Mr Colls told Salisbury Deputy Mayor Chad Buchanan about the issue on Friday. Mr Buchanan had a look at it over the weekend and posted about it on Facebook on Sunday alongside the message ""You had one job"". ""It certainly brings a whole new meaning to a shared pathway,"" he told ABC Radio Adelaide today. ""It was certainly something that I wouldn't have thought we'd see pop up in the middle of a shared path, but I have been told that SAPN (SA Power Networks) … will be realigning the shared path, which has been somewhat reassuring, but in the meantime it is dangerous and there needs to be some adequate signage and particularly some lighting around it at night-time because it is dangerous for cyclists and that is something I've asked our staff to follow up over the weekend."" According to a development application approved by former planning minister Vickie Chapman a year ago, the power lines are being built to connect to a new gas and diesel power station at the nearby Bolivar Wastewater Treatment Plant. A condition of the approval was that all infrastructure damaged during the development be reinstated at SA Power Networks' cost. The work included removing seven regulated trees. SA Power Networks corporate affairs manager Paul Roberts said the pole had to be in the middle of the path because one side was a wetland and moving it the other direction would have necessitated trimming a tree, which the company did not want to do. A second pole is next to the path — rather than in the middle of it — but has a fence around it that also blocks the bikeway. Mr Roberts was unsure when the pole had been installed but said its location was chosen in consultation with the City of Salisbury council. ""The intention was originally to reinstate the path when we removed the second old pole in early July,"" he said. ""What we'll do instead is we will now this week get a subcontractor to reinstate the path to the right of where the pole is located and we'll then have to do some further reinstatement after we remove the other pole, which I think will happen some time in early July. ""So, look, there's really sensible reasons why it's there and we have an intention and a plan with the council to put the bikeway back but just to the right of the existing bikeway."" He said stobie poles had to be installed using large trucks, so it may not have been suitable to move the bike path first. ""We'll use this instance, as we always do, as a really excellent opportunity to do a post-project review just to see what we could have done better and, if there are things we could do better, we'll integrate that into our future thinking for these types of works,"" he said.

90,"Newcastle bus drivers strike over stalled pay talks, frustrating local commuters",business,"  Newcastle bus drivers on 24-hour strike for pay rise to meet cost-of-living pressure The Rail, Tram and Bus Union (RTBU) has apologised for today's strike in Newcastle but says the action is necessary to achieve ""reasonable"" pay for bus drivers. Members working on bus routes operated by Keolis Downer have started a 24-hour strike action after a breakdown in pay negotiations. About 150 Hunter bus routes were not in service, including school runs, disrupting the morning commute for students and workers. ""I apologise to the public. This is action that the members don't take lightly,"" said union spokesman Daniel Jaggers. ""As we've seen, inflation and the cost of fuel has gone through the roof. Groceries are starting to cost a lot more than they used to. ""Members want to make sure that they don't go behind."" Get local stories told by the people who are living them with the Newcastle Hunter Catch Up podcast. The RTBU is pushing for a 7 per cent pay increase over two years for bus drivers, which local commuter David said was ""a bit unreasonable"". ""I understand the cost-of-living pressures and stuff like that, but the rest of us in private enterprises are having to struggle along without big pay increases,"" he said. David walked from the Junction to Newcastle Interchange to get a train after realising there were no buses and said the strike had caused a ""really big inconvenience"". Commuter Kathy supported the strike but said a 5 per cent pay rise would be more realistic. ""All the essential workers, like bus drivers, cleaners, aged care and nurses have not have pay rises for quite some time,"" she said. ""These people work all sorts of hours and weekends and stuff and I think they deserve to be heard."" As many as 40 bus drivers gathered for the strike action. ""We're trying to do it as peaceful and legal as possible,"" one driver said. ""From the company's point of view, I hope they are trying to look at it that we are being reasonable … we're just trying to stay afloat."" Another bus driver said the actions of Keolis Downer from this point could determine their future in the industry. ""Everybody has different individual circumstances, and we have to weigh that up with our families and our working life,"" the driver said. ""I'll certainly be reassessing my own situation if things don't improve."" Keolis Downer said Monday's strike was disappointing for those who relied on Newcastle buses, and encouraged the union to resolve the dispute through discussions rather than industrial action. The private operator said it would continue to negotiate in good faith to reach an outcome. Newcastle Light Rail and ferries were running as normal.

91,"ASX falls after biggest weekly loss since 2020 on interest rate, energy stocks offset gains in banks",business,"  ASX falls after biggest weekly loss since 2020 on interest rate, energy stocks offset gains in banks Australian shares have struggled for momentum on Monday after falling to their worst week in more than two years as energy and mining stocks countered gains in banks. The ASX 200 closed down 41 points, or 0.6 per cent to 6,433. At the same time, the Australian dollar was up at 69.67 US cents. The benchmark sank 1.8 per cent on Friday in its sixth straight session of falls. Mining stocks fell about 5.1 per cent after benchmark iron ore prices extended losses on Friday as Chinese steel mills opted to reduce output amid weak profits and deteriorating demand prospects. Sector heavyweights BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue skidded between 5.1 per cent and 8.6 per cent, with Fortescue touching its lowest level since March 17. Energy stocks fell 5.2 per cent to be the biggest laggards on the main index, after oil prices dropped on Friday on worries that interest rate hikes by major central banks could cut energy demand. Sector heavyweights Woodside Energy and Santos skidded 4.9 per cent and 6 per cent respectively. Financials rose 0.6 per cent after a nine-session losing streak, with the ""Big Four"" banks trading in positive territory. The Commonwealth Bank, the country's biggest lender, led gains with a 0.3 per cent rise, while Westpac was flat. Among individual stocks, Infomedia jumped 7.4 per cent and was headed for its best day since May 16 after receiving a $638.8 million buyout proposal from US-based software company Solera Holdings LLC. Among the top movers were Pointsbet (+18.6pc), Harvey Norman (+4.5pc) and Home Consortium (+5.6pc). Meanwhile, Lake Resources (-13.7pc), Bega Cheese (-8.1pc), De Grey Mining (-10.2pc) and Beach Energy (-8.3pc) were among the worst performers. Brent crude oil was up, trading at $US113.51 a barrel, by 4:38pm AEST. World stocks on Friday closed out their steepest weekly slide since the pandemic meltdown of March 2020, as investors worried that tighter monetary policy by inflation-fighting central banks could damage economic growth. The US Federal Reserve's biggest rate hike since 1994, the first such Swiss move in 15 years, a fifth rise in British rates since December and a move by the European Central Bank to bolster the indebted south all took turns roiling markets. The Bank of Japan was the only outlier in a week where money prices rose around the world, sticking on Friday with its strategy of pinning 10-year yields near zero. The Australian share market will need to fall at least a further 5 per cent from the current 15 per cent to be classed as a ""bear"" market. David Taylor breaks down what happens next. After sharp early losses, world stocks steadied somewhat to end Friday's session down by just 0.12 per cent. The weekly slide of 5.8 per cent was the steepest since the week of March 20, 2020. Wall Street's Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.13 per cent, the S&P 500 added 0.22 per cent, and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.43 per cent. For the week, the S&P 500 dropped 5.8 per cent, also its biggest fall since the third week of 2020. ""Inflation, the war and lockdowns in China have derailed the global recovery,"" economists at Bank of America said in a note to clients, adding they see a 40 per cent chance of a recession in the United States next year as the Fed keeps raising rates. ""We look for GDP growth to slow to almost zero, inflation to settle at around 3 per cent and the Fed to hike rates above 4 per cent."" The Fed on Friday said its commitment to fight inflation is ""unconditional"". Fears that its rate hikes could trigger a recession supported Treasury prices and slowed the rise in yields, which fall when prices rise. Ten-year Treasury yields retreated to 3.22944 per cent after hitting an 11-year high of 3.498 per cent on Tuesday. Southern European bond yields dropped sharply after reports of more detail from ECB President Christine Lagarde on the central bank's plans. ""The more aggressive line by central banks adds to headwinds for both economic growth and equities,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. ""The risks of a recession are rising, while achieving a soft landing for the US economy appears increasingly challenging."" The ASX slumps after yesterday's rally on Wall Street vanishes in a sea of red, with investors taking flight as both the UK and Switzerland raise official interest rates. In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell to a five-week low, dragged by selling in Australia. Japan's Nikkei fell 1.8 per cent and headed for a weekly drop of almost 7 per cent. Bonds and currencies were jittery after a rollercoaster week. The yen tanked after the Bank of Japan stuck to its ultra-accommodative policy stance. The yen fell 2.2 per cent by late Friday, bolstering the US dollar, which rose 0.73 per cent against a basket of major currencies. Sterling fell 1 per cent in New York as investors focused on the gap between US and UK rates. The Bank of England is opting for a more moderate approach than the Fed. ""If a central bank does not move aggressively, yields and risk price in more in the way of rate hikes down the road,"" said NatWest Markets' strategist John Briggs.

92,Draft plan would see coal and gas power stations paid to offer stable supply,business,"  New 'capacity mechanism' could pay coal and gas generators for reliable electricity supply A draft plan for a new ""capacity mechanism"", aimed at ensuring stability in the national electricity grid, could see coal and gas generators paid for reliable power supply. The federal government's Energy Security Board (ESB) has been tasked with designing the new mechanism, which would pay generators through an auction process for the capacity they can provide. Currently, generators in the national electricity market — which serves the east coast and South Australia — are only paid for the electricity they produce. The new system would also pay for generators to be available when needed. The ESB said introducing such a tool by mid-2025 was going to be vital to ensuring much more capacity enters the grid in coming decades, and a smooth transition to net zero emissions by 2050. There have been calls for the new mechanism to exclude existing generators, particularly coal and gas. But the board argued it was important that the mechanism could access a mix of technologies, and discourage the early exit of existing generators before new generators — like more renewables — were ready to take their place. The Albanese government is blaming the energy crisis engulfing eastern Australia on the Coalition’s failure to put in place policy to ensure adequate and timely investment in renewables. That’s correct, but it’s not the whole story. States and territories would still be given the final say on which generators were eligible for the payments in their jurisdiction. The Victorian government had previously insisted states be given the right to determine which technologies were supported, arguing incentives should only be directed toward zero-emissions technology. Victorian Energy Minister Lily D'Ambrosio said the ESB's plan provided the flexibility they wanted to see. ""We have always been clear that a capacity market operating in Victoria would make payments to zero-emissions technologies and not fossil fuels,"" Ms D'Ambrosio said. The board's draft plan said the mechanism could actually see net zero emissions in energy achieved earlier than anticipated. ""Designed well, the capacity mechanism will enable a swifter, less risky and more orderly transition to a net zero emissions energy system,"" it said. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the proposal appeared sensible. ""It's an insurance scheme into the energy system,"" he said. ""And that seems to me to be a bit of common sense."" The board warned there was going to be significant demand for more power to enter the national grid in the coming decades, meaning stability and certainty will be vital to encouraging new investment. It warned that many coal generators were reaching the end of their useful lives, while electricity demand was expected to more than double over the next 30 or so years. Forecasting ahead to 2050, it said the grid would require the equivalent of 50 new Snowy Hydro schemes to enter the market. It also addressed concerns the cost of paying generators to provide capacity would be passed onto consumers, and force up power prices. The ESB said that outcome could be avoided. ""From a customer point of view, the risks of a disorderly transition would be reduced, including avoiding elevated high prices due to scarcity and the disruption and costs of load shedding,"" it said. ""The ESB is aware of concerns that a capacity mechanism could cause customers to pay more for the same level of service. ""This is clearly not the intent, and it will be avoided through careful design."" The current draft is now open for public comment, and a detailed plan will be put to energy ministers at the end of the year. Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the board's proposal was a positive step forward. ""The Energy Security Board's release of this consultation paper is welcome,"" Mr Bowen said. ""It follows agreement by all energy ministers earlier this month that the ESB should undertake this next step in energy market reform. ""While there is still a ways to go, it will allow market participants and experts to express their views, and puts us back on track in reforming an energy market that has undergone rapid change, but was neglected by the Commonwealth in recent years."" Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the ESB's proposal struck the right balance between preparing for more renewables to enter the system and protecting reliability. ""We will develop a capacity mechanism which works for the task at hand,"" he said. ""Which is to ensure reliability as we undertake this massive transformation in our energy grid, to being much more renewably focused. ""To being focused on achieving our climate ambitions, but also achieving so in a way which does in no sense undermine reliability for Australians."" But Greens leader Adam Bandt said any scheme that served to keep coal and gas-fired generators running longer could not be supported. ""Paying them to stay in the system longer is only going to prolong the problems, and also prolong the transition to renewables,"" Mr Bandt said. ""The idea of paying coal and gas to stay in the system isn't just going to make the climate crisis worse, it's going to reward the big corporations who have been holding us to ransom.""

93,'Quite dangerous': Rain and pigeon droppings force wartime bomber to come down after 50 years,business,"  Forbes' iconic De Havilland Vampire jet to come down after 50 years, amid public safety risk The future of a Royal Australian Air Force fighter-bomber is up in the air due to concerns its deteriorating condition has become a public safety risk. The De Havilland Vampire jet, which flew during the Korean War, has sat perched up on a pole in Forbes since 1971, overlooking the town's lake. After it crash-landed just west of the town in the 1950s, it was retired to become a training aircraft before the Forbes Shire Council purchased it for the 50th anniversary of the RAAF. The Australian-made De Havilland jet survived conflict but has not been able to withstand the weather conditions or wear-and-tear from pigeon droppings, with the acidic mixture causing the nose to crack and separate from the body. Forbes Mayor Phyllis Miller said it would be remiss not to take it down. ""It's quite dangerous,"" Cr Miller said. The question was whether it would return, but the council planned to do all it could to fix the ""icon"". ""I'm pretty certain the people of Forbes don't want to lose it altogether,"" the mayor said. It is unclear how much it would cost to repair the aircraft and funds have not been allocated to it in a budget that is already under pressure. Mike De La Hunt from the HARS Parkes Aviation Museum, who has repaired aircraft of the same model, estimated it could cost anywhere from $10,000 to $100,000, depending on how many volunteers put their hand up. ""It won't be straightforward but it is certainly worthwhile preserving it seeing that aircraft has become such a part of Forbes life,"" Mr De La Hunt said. He warned it should come down quickly if the goal was to preserve its ""significant history"". He said similar cases of drooping noses on the ""very complex aircraft"" have been successfully fixed in the past. That has involved replacing the wooden features with fibreglass to retain its appearance but making it weatherproof and lightweight. ""It is a significant icon and we would hope that it would be preserved,"" he said. ""There is no reason why it couldn't be up there for another 20-odd years.""

94,'A slow revolution': Could the future of all work exist on the blockchain?,business,"  Known best as the host of cryptocurrencies, experts and economists say blockchain technology could be the future of working life Lynsey Jackson was looking for a change when she quit her corporate finance job to assess her career options, before settling on a direction that would shock many. She sees her future in blockchain technology, beginning with a diploma of applied blockchain from TAFE Queensland. Most commonly known as the platform that hosts cryptocurrencies, blockchain is the basis of ""Web3"", the brave new internet held together by distributed databases, each confirming the same information. Blockchain is a peer-to-peer security network that allows users to become part of the system. In relation to cryptocurrencies the system validates coin ownership and transactions, as well as works to create new coins. ""Most people when I mention that I'm pivoting my career into blockchain don't really know what I'm talking about and what the opportunities are ... for the most part, people in my world are pretty unaware,"" Ms Jackson said. ""It seems to be the most innovative sort of revolutionary space to be in right now with the transferable skills that I have coming from finance. ""It can improve things like tracking and traceability and reducing fraud … We can use that sort of technology to make the world a more fair and inclusive and sustainable place for everyone."" As for what she wants to do in the industry? ""That is the million-dollar question,"" she said. ""That's why I've enrolled in the diploma."" Ms Jackson first learned of blockchain the way most do: cryptocurrency. According to CHOICE, one in nine Australians invested in a cryptocurrency within the last 12 months and a further 11 per cent are interested in investing. But Ms Jackson, who ""holds"" investments in some of the major coins, said that isn't what drew her to study the technology. ""What's actually happening in the blockchain space is far beyond just what we know about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency and an opportunity to get rich quick,"" she said. According to economist and futurist Steve Sammartino, a better public understanding of the difference between cryptocurrencies and blockchain is fundamental to the latter's future success, or failure. ""The fact that they get bundled into the same category is kind of problematic,"" he said. ""Cryptocurrencies are a single-use case for blockchain … blockchain has incredible upside and potential to reshape the entire fabric of the economy."" Cryptocurrencies are infamously volatile and there are currently about 10,000 on the market. Mr Sammartino said some cryptocurrency will be needed if blockchain is to be used for large-scale financial transactions, but the current proliferation and instability degrades any value as a viable replacement for fiat money. He believes there is a role for government in what has up to this point been a largely unregulated space. ""Regulation frames what we believe as community and society, that's the first part. The second part is education in schools,"" he said. ""The challenge is that the space is changing so rapidly, regular regulation and education can't keep up because there's always the next thing or the next iteration on a rapidly evolving technology. ""That gives the hucksters that five minutes to get in front and to say, 'OK, boomer, you don't understand.'"" Danielle Marie is trying to get in front of the hucksters. She teaches the applied blockchain diploma at TAFE Queensland. Ms Marie said many of her students enrol in the course hoping to learn more about investing in cryptocurrencies, but leave with more concrete goals. ""Crypto is the gateway drug to blockchain,"" she said. She said most of her students will become either project managers and planners or business analysts, positions added to the skilled migrant occupation list in 2019, indicating a need for more people with blockchain knowledge and training in Australia. An old lead and zinc mine on the west coast of Tasmania could become home to ""Australia's largest emerging, 100 per cent renewable energy bitcoin mine"". Those jobs fall within the category of information and communications technology (ICT), and while it is unclear what portion of the jobs on offer in this sector will be blockchain related, projections expect a further 20,000 positions in Australia for ICT managers and analysts by 2026. There is already considered to be a shortage of ICT managers nationally, with a strong future demand expected. Ms Marie agrees with Mr Sammartino that blockchain is misunderstood when it is only viewed through the cryptocurrency lens. ""At the end of the day, it's just a way of us storing data,"" she said. ""Most of the students that are studying these courses will end up going down either project management, business analyst, consultant, educator, or a kind of a research analyst role."" Ms Marie said better access to industry is key to a broader understanding of the technology. ""We need collaboration between government, organisations and communities to work together to offer education to people."" Jock McQueenie from the QUT school of design has experience working with blockchain. In 2019 he worked with Beefledger, a project using blockchain technology in an attempt to eliminate fraud from the beef industry, tracking the product from Australian pastures to the plates of China. ""They were developing data from one end of the supply chain to the other, you know, Fitbits on cows, measuring the metabolisms all the way through to the packaging and the consumer experience,"" Dr McQueenie said. He described his role as an intermediary on both ends, bringing life to the story the customer was told and convincing farmers it was a good idea. Dr McQueenie is now working on a similar project tracking fair trade coffee from source to customer in the Pacific. He said there are blockchain affiliated jobs that don't require deep knowledge of the technology, just an appreciation for it. ""I think the potential for jobs related to it are not necessarily in the depth of the tech, but in linking that to a human outcome,"" he said. ""What I'm doing is translating what [the technology does] to a broader audience. ""My role is joining up dots, rather than being an expert in technology."" QUT cryptography PhD candidate Thomas Miller's work does come from the depth of tech. Mr Miller said courses like the one Ms Jackson are great ""induction courses"", but he too would like to see better education and regulation around blockchain and internet security in general. ""Just the way you go and get a safety card on a [work] site, that should be something that you do when you're managing a blockchain account,"" he said. He believes blockchain will restructure the workforce, with less company structures and more security for workers — a world where completed jobs can be easily tracked and paid for. ""I think the paradigm shift in the way we even think about [work] is going to be big,"" he said. ""We're so used to interacting with the company structure, then the company implements business processes — it's the business processes that are valuable to society."" We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Mr Miller said it won't matter the task, whether it is a physical job just as planting a tree or an online one such as website design or accounting, everything that has value will be traceable and transferring will be simple. ""The idea of a company shell will slowly sort of shed away … it will just be the business processes and the humans that commit to those will get paid for every instance of the business process that they complete,"" he said. ""I think it's just a slow revolution, or slow change, societal change. ""It's just literally inevitable, because it's a better solution to do it this way.""

95,"'Cranking coffees in the morning, shaking cocktails at night': Snow workers stretch hours as job vacancies bite",business,"  National worker shortage extends from centre of biggest cities to most remote mountains There's no traffic on Leah Szmalko's commute. After a 10-minute drive, she clicks on skis and slides down the hill for a day of making hot coffees and serving cold beers at Hoff Hut, overlooking Mt Hotham’s premier ski run. ""Anyone in cities, if you need to change scenery, why not?"" she asks. ""How could you not? I ski to work!"" Leah is working hard with two jobs — ""Morning coffees and shakin' cocktails by night"" — as ski resorts struggle to fill roles and keep a surge of visitors happy. But it's not just regional and remote areas suffering from a shortage of workers. This is a nationwide problem. When Cassandra Winzar talks to businesses, Australia's labour shortage is the top issue — more pressing than energy prices, supply chains or a rise in the minimum wage. ""It's across all industries, all locations and all professions."" There are more than 423,000 job vacancies, on recent data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. That's a record high. ""And it's a record high by a pretty significant degree,"" says Ms Winzar, senior economist at the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA). ""If we look back to, say, February 2020, just before the pandemic, there were only around 227,000 job vacancies,"" she said. ""So we've seen a huge increase in just a couple of years"". The underemployment rate, calculating people who would like more work, just hit a 14-year low, dropping from 6.1 per cent to 5.7 per cent. The under-utilisation rate — a combination of the underemployment and unemployment rate — has tumbled to a 40-year low. Businesses are dealing with the shortage in different ways. Some operators in the alpine area are reducing hours, trimming the number of menu options and closing mid-week to give exhausted employees time to recover. All are desperate to keep up levels of service so that visitors have the best experience on their brief holidays. Up on the mountain, that means staff like Ms Szmalko are just working more hours. ""A full day? Would usually be here by 7.30 in the morning and knock off at the other job, maybe 11, 12 o'clock at night,"" she said. ""And start all over again the next day."" Nathan Butterworth, general manager of Mt Hotham Skiing Company, has a staff of 600 running the lifts and services at the Victorian resort. He described workers doing more hours as part of a ""defence strategy"" to deal with an expected flood of visitors ahead of a predicted bumper snow season. ""Encouraging people to be fully employed, and to consider their other options, is another way that they can contribute to the teams,"" he said. ""We've got a passionate group of people that remain incredibly committed not only to the industry but to their chosen home resorts."" The COVID pandemic has exposed a problem experts have been warning about for years — a lack of workers. ""This labour shortage has been a long time coming,"" says Alison Preston, professor of economics and the University of Western Australia Business School. ""COVID really has, in the end, just been the catalyst that's exposed everything"". The first and most obvious factor is immigration. Australia has typically relied on migration for two-thirds of its population growth but when the pandemic hit in early 2020, international students and people on working visas were urged to leave. Those remaining were excluded from many of the support measures that helped the local population through the crisis – as queues of students relied on charity food banks to stay alive. While Australia's borders have re-opened, experts like Professor Preston see only a slow recovery in the number of workers migrating here. Finding affordable childcare is also difficult. Pensioners can be penalised if they earn over a certain limit. And settings in our tax and welfare systems — even things like the rigidity of school hours — reduce the number of people who can work or the hours they can toil. ""We've not had necessarily the flexibility that we've wanted in the labour market,"" Professor Preston said. ""As we tried to fix one problem, be it thresholds or tax changes or whatever else, we impose another problem in there."" A key issue, particularly in regional and coastal areas, has been a lack of affordable housing. Hoff Hut operator Jamie Walker had to look far for his staff — ""We had to go a fair way around … Queensland, Tasmania, Victoria"" — and once they were secured, he had to find somewhere for them to live. With another business, he's hired a house in nearby Dinner Plain to house four of his staff. ""It's the extra costs up-front we have to fork out to secure the accommodation for our staff — that's the biggest killer for us,"" he said. The resort has to house around 85 per cent of its staff. For Nathan Butterworth, the issue isn't just the expense. ""I think that becomes the real challenge — not necessarily the availability of housing, it's the availability at a reasonable price, to make sure that we can provide the services and experiences that people expect at a reasonable price,"" he said. ""The other piece is obviously wherever we're consuming accommodation for our seasonal workplace, we're displacing … accommodation that would otherwise be available to people that are looking to come and enjoy themselves"". One solution to Australia's labour shortage is, essentially, to squeeze the lemon harder. Getting available workers to take on more hours means service levels can be kept up — and visitors kept happy. ""When you've got a finite number of beds and a finite amount of space, we're encouraging people to be fully employed and to consider all the options in the way that they can contribute to the teams,"" Mr Butterworth said. That's what Ms Szmalko is doing. When ABC News caught up with her, it was on her first break after 12 days straight. ""Most of my friends that I know do have two or three jobs,"" she said. ""We're here for four months and we work hard and we're here to work hard, as much as we are here to ski.""

96,The biggest moments from the 2022 Logie Awards,business,"  A win for representation and a 'cheating' skit were among the memorable 2022 Logie Awards moments After a three-year break, the Logie Awards came back in 2022 — and with a bang. These were the biggest moments of the night: Australian of the year Dylan Alcott and ABC presenter Tony Armstrong presented the award for Most Outstanding Sports Coverage. Both Armstrong and Alcott spoke about what it meant for them to be up on that stage. Alcott spoke about this year's event being a win for representation. “To be honest, having an Indigenous man and a guy in a wheelchair up here, on commercial TV …"" ""We’ve got a long way to go to get representation, but it’s massive,” Alcott said. Legendary sports broadcaster Bruce McAvaney received a standing ovation from the audience at the Gold Coast Convention Centre when he was inducted into the TV Week Logie Hall of Fame. ""It is undeniable that so many of Australia's most iconic sporting moments have been made much more memorable by the words of Bruce McAvaney,"" said former AFL player and coach Leigh Matthews, who presented the lifetime achievement award. Accepting the industry-voted award on stage, McAvaney said: ""I am emotional but my voice is not as strong as it should be tonight. ""I wondered how I'd feel tonight when I walked up here. I feel a lot of love actually and a lot of warmth."" In 2017, McAvaney revealed he was diagnosed with leukaemia two years previously after an abnormal blood test. Last year the 69-year-old stepped back from AFL commentary ahead of the 2021 season but said he wasn't reconsidering retirement. Ms Wilkinson's interview with Brittany Higgins won the Logie for Most Outstanding News Coverage or Public Affairs Report. She said that, after 40 years in journalism, it was ""by far"" the most important work she had ever done. ""I knew it from the very first phone call I had early last year with a young woman whose name she told me was Brittany Higgins,"" she said. ""Four incredibly intense, sleepless weeks later, when our story went to air, the entire country knew the name Brittany Higgins."" ""This honour belongs to Brittany."" While presenting the award for Most Popular Reality Program, Australian comedy duo Hamish Blake and Andy Lee spoke of how voting in the Logies ""cannot be rigged"" as Australians can only vote once. The duo then launched into a skit that blamed Karl Stefanovic for cheating in the Gold Logie race. Blake and Lee brought out a young boy Oliver who claimed he had been kept in a room for hours, forced to vote repeatedly for one of the nominees. ""Oliver, who is the person who made you do this?"" Blake and Lee asked. ""It was Karl Stefanovic,"" Oliver responded. Blake and Lee asked how many votes he was forced to send in, to which the boy replied ""thousands"". This category opened with a tribute to Neighbours, production of which will come to an end later this year. Natalie Bassingthwaighte said many people who have won this Logie have come from the show. However, this year's award went to ABC Breakfast's Armstrong, who took the opportunity to thank his mum. ""There's a lot of people I need to thank,"" he said. ""The old cheese, my mum, she is a superstar. [She] has done everything for me and has been a superstar and I would not be up here without her, so a big thanks to her. ""Please give her a clap, she will love it back home."" Here is the full list of winners for the Logie Awards 2022 In his true style, Blake brought his funny antics into his speech. ""This counts for three. Oh my God. That is — I've won one two years ago. To win four of these is … that's too much."" Earlier in the evening, Blake also won the inaugural Bert Newton award.

98,'There's just no room to move': Cafe boss warns small businesses will disappear without local customer support,business,"  Inflation pressures push Gold Coast business owners to raise prices From farm gate to cafe plate, inflation and the rising cost of living are causing chaos for business owners and consumers, with coffee and vegetables the latest produce affected. Lettuce prices went through the roof earlier this month to reach $11 a pop, leading some major fast-food outlets to use cabbage as a replacement. Punnets of some berries are now selling for up to $13. But farmers and business owners say it is not just lettuce and berries taking a hit, it is everything on the menu and in the shop. Gold Coast cafe owner Tolua Scott said she was looking at moving one of her three outlets to running on solar just to help her stay afloat. ""There's nothing left to absorb,"" Ms Scott said. ""We've already been through that over two-and-a-half years and gone into considerable debt to get through it, so we have to pass it on."" Ms Scott said she had been told it was unlikely there would be a price reprieve for several years and her products, including coffee, would be impacted. ""Everything's gone up in price,” she said. ""There's just no room to move … the way we look at it is try to support small businesses because if you don't, we won't be there."" Fruit and vegetable wholesaler Don Meers, of Q Growers Market, said his outlet was not doing much better. He started his career in the 1980s and said he had never seen such high prices. ""We're going to be in this situation for at least the next six to eight weeks,"" he said. Mr Meers said items that were not regular staples had risen in price, with six womboks costing wholesalers $90. ""Six months ago we'd pay $2 for cabbage and sell it for $2.99, now it's $11 and we have to shelf it for $10.99 to sell,"" he said. ""We've lost the seedlings of everything, so our major suppliers haven't got any products. ""And now with fuel and freight costs, you've really got to pay for it. I've never seen it like this."" Food producers say a wage increase for some of Australia's lowest paid workers will have to be passed on to consumers. Mr Meers said while consumers would be feeling the bill shock, farmers were likely the worst hit. He said he had witnessed customers browsing numerous grocery stores looking at prices before choosing where to shop. ""Customers used to walk in and just pick up off the shelf and not look at a price,"" he said. ""But now I see people going to Coles, Woolworths and Aldi, the fruit shop, looking at picking with the price more than anything."" Gold Coast Chamber of Commerce president Martin Hall said businesses were hurting. ""We've gone through a relatively stable period where confidence picked up a little bit, but the punches keep coming,"" Mr Halls said. ""Anything that increases that cost of doing business is going to hurt. ""Now you're getting increases to power prices and the federal government is pushing through the minimum wage increase, it's just more and more levels. Mr Hall said small businesses would reach a point where the costs were going to start impacting the end user. ""We really just need to make sure we get behind our businesses and keep trading with them,"" he said.

99,Biggest compensation payout in Australian history looms for Toyota after court ruling,business,"  Australians dudded by faulty HiLux, Prado and Fortuner vehicles able to apply for compensation Hundreds of thousands of Australians who were sold defective Toyota vehicles will be able to apply for compensation from today. It comes after a Federal Court judgement handed down in April that found more than 260,000 Toyota vehicles were defective when sold. The court found Toyota HiLux, Prado and Fortuner vehicles sold between October 1, 2015 and April 23, 2020 were sold with faulty diesel particulate filters (DPF). Lawyers alleged the faulty filters decreased fuel efficiency, caused foul-smelling emissions and increased the wear and tear on engines. The court found the defect led to a 17.5 per cent reduction in the value of the affected vehicles at the time they were sold. It also found Toyota had engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in marketing and selling the cars. Partner with law firm Gilbert + Tobin Matt Mackenzie said the Federal Court's decision was significant and could leave Toyota footing a historically large bill. ""It's one of the few instances of the Federal Court exercising its power to award aggregate damage,"" Mr McKenzie said. An estimated 260,000 drivers purchased defective Toyota HiLux, Prado and Fortuner vehicles in the time period. With an expected average compensation payout of $10,500 per vehicle, Toyota could be facing a total compensation bill of more than $2.7 billion. ""It will depend on how many group members register their interest,"" Mr McKenzie said. ""If a significant number of those group members do come forward, then there is a possibility — or a likelihood actually — that this will be the largest compensation payout in Australian history."" Toyota has committed to opposing the Federal Court's decision, stating in a press release it would lodge an appeal. Up to 250,000 Australian cars could be affected as a major class action is filed against popular manufacturer Toyota. ""Toyota's appeal includes challenges to the factual and legal basis for the award of damages, particularly in circumstances where many of the group members did not experience the DPF issue,"" the statement read. Toyota also stated it would continue to offer free-of-charge repairs to any vehicle owners affected by the DPF issue. The ABC reached out to Toyota for comment. Mr McKenzie said while his firm was committed to defending the appeal, compensation could be delayed by the legal action. ""There won't be any payouts until that appeal has been determined,"" he said. ""It turns on the availability of the parties and of the full court, but it's not unexpected for that to take somewhere in the order of 12 months."" Toyota HiLux, Prado and Fortuner owners wanting to register their interest to receive compensation under the judgement can do so from 10am June 20 through the online portal.

100,'Catastrophic' substation fire causes millions of dollars in damage,business,"  Yallah substation fire leaves Transgrid with rebuild cost of up to $10m An investigation is underway into the cause of a large fire that engulfed a power substation south of Wollongong, resulting in millions of dollars in damage. Around 3pm on Saturday one of four transformers at the Yallah substation failed, causing multiple explosions which started an oil fire. Approximately 60 fire fighters responded to the incident, which occurred two kilometres from the Tallawarra power station. They managed to contain the blaze and secure some 100,000 litres of oil. The facility's operator, Transgrid, will investigate the exact cause of the mechanical failure. ""There will be an investigation process that any asset failure goes through,"" Transgrid's general manager of maintenance, Ian Davidson, said. ""With this particular incident it is too early to speculate what the exact cause was."" Fire crews remain at the scene monitoring a small fire which is continuing to burn. Transgrid will begin the process of replacing the destroyed transformer. ""The unit that failed is definitely a write-off,"" Mr Davidson said. ""It is catastrophic damage to itself and the immediate surrounding infrastructure. ""It will take a replacement program, civil rebuild [and] replacement of minor equipment surrounding it."" He estimated the replacement project would cost between $6 million and $10 million. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) confirmed the fire had no impact on the electricity supply for NSW residents. The three remaining transformers will continue to supply power while the damaged unit is replaced. ""Our substations have multiple units, so we have three other transformers that have the same capacity down here which will continue to supply the local area,"" Mr Davidson said. ""We will now begin to start the work that will replace that failed unit with one of our strategic spares."" The incident is not believed to be a result of the recent increase in electricity demand.

101,"Russia's war in Ukraine is risking global famine, warns EU specialist",business,"  Russia is putting the world at risk of famine through its blockade of Ukraine's shipments of grains and restrictions on its own exports, according to EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. The threat to food security — and a ""battle of narrative"" with Russia concerning Western-imposed sanctions on Moscow over Ukraine — will dominate the upcoming European Union foreign ministers' talks in Luxembourg. ""We are ready to work with the UN and our partners to prevent any unwanted impact on global food security,"" Mr Borrell said in an article published on his official blog. Ukraine's war with Russia is exacerbating an already alarming global food crisis. ""Russia's conscious political choice is to 'weaponise' grain exports and 'use them as a tool for blackmail against anyone [who] opposes its aggression' in Ukraine,"" Mr Borrell said. He said Russia had turned the Black Sea ""into a war zone, blocking shipments of grain and fertiliser from Ukraine but also affecting Russian merchant shipping"". ""Russia is also applying quotas and taxes on its grain exports,"" he added. The sanctions imposed by the EU ""do not prohibit Russia to export any agricultural goods, payment for such Russian exports or the provision of seeds, provided that sanctioned individuals or entities are not involved"". ""We are fully aware that there is a 'battle of narratives' around this issue [of sanctions],"" Mr Borrell said. He added that it was imperative for Ukrainian exports be allowed to resume by ship. ""We are working closely with the UN on this issue and the EU and its member states are ready to do their part of the necessary actions to achieve this,"" he said. ""We hope that a solution can be found in the coming days. Not doing this threatens to cause a global food catastrophe."" While the ongoing war in Ukraine has made it increasingly difficult for the country to export its major crop, Ukraine has also accused Russia of outright theft of grain from the territories where Russian forces are occupying. Aerial images collected by US satellite imagery company Maxar appear to show Russian-flagged ships carrying grain harvested in Ukraine and transporting it to Syria, a close ally of Russia. Two Russian-flagged bulk carrier ships that docked in the Russian-controlled Crimean port of Sevastopol in May were pictured being loaded with grain. Images from Maxar Technologies show two Russian-flagged ships being loaded with grain in the Russian-controlled Crimean port of Sevastopol before being spotted in Syria several days later. Days later, Maxar satellites collected images of the same ships docked in Syria, with their hatches open and trucks lined-up, ready to haul the grain away. Speaking at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, Russian president Vladimir Putin said that, while Russia could ""significantly increase its export of food and fertiliser"", he expressed concern that Ukraine might use income from exports to pay for weapons. Despite Mr Putin's claims and apparent shipments to allies such as Syria, Russian grain isn't getting out into the global market either, with Moscow placing the blame on a sweep of international sanctions against Russian banking and shipping industries.

102,Community gardens offer free produce — and a chance to learn new skills — as rising costs bite,business,"  Community gardens offer free produce — and a chance to learn new skills — as rising costs bite At a time when an iceberg lettuce can cost as much as $12, a trip to the supermarket can easily stretch many household budgets to the limit. Community gardens could be the answer many Australians have been searching for. They have been sprouting up across a wide range of local communities for decades. Although the exact number of community gardens is unknown, there are hundreds registered across Australia, so chances are there is one in your neighbourhood. While some are fenced off and may require membership, others are open anytime, to anyone. Husband and wife Josh and Tallara Palmer helped set up the Gum Tree Community Garden project at Littlehampton in the Adelaide Hills. They say there was never any question about making it free and accessible to the whole community. ""It's open to anyone — it's a safe space for everyone to kind of come and mingle and join together — and it was really about bringing the community together and connecting people in a day and age when we're not as connected,"" Mr Palmer said. ""When I drive past, I see people in here chatting and gardening together and that's what it's really all about."" The garden, like many others, also offers a Grow Free! cart system where locals can drop off excess produce for their neighbours. Stuart and Valerie Gilmore are regular volunteers at the garden and help maintain it all year round. ""It's giving back to people. It's wonderful in this particular community to be able to sort of come together,"" Mr Gilmore said. ""It's so lovely when you think about all the people around here can come in, they can get something free."" Mr Gilmore said it was a chance to connect with neighbours and to help each other out. ""Things are tough and the young families out there. Some of the mums [who] have popped in with their children have expressed that … during COVID, some of them lost work or their work hours were reduced, so the fact they could come in and get something free and take that with them was obviously going to help out at home,"" he said. Greg Martin is among a group of residents who helped set up the Walyu Yarta Community Garden in Adelaide's southern parklands more than a decade ago. ""We got together and lobbied council — that took a long time because this was the first community garden in the parklands,"" he said. ""Over the years, they've come to really think this is an asset in the parklands, which I think it is, and [the council] have been very supportive."" Mr Martin has helped keep the garden running since its inception and says he has learned a few tricks along the way. ""I didn't know anything about gardening, but you come down here and you meet people who have gardened for 40, 50 years and are a wealth of information so you learn a lot just by being with them,"" he said. He says residents in nearby city apartment buildings have also come to value the social aspect it brings. ""This is a marvellous opportunity for people who might feel a little bit isolated in the city that they can come down and meet their neighbours,"" Mr Martin said. Although some people may feel shy about taking produce for free, those who run the gardens say they should not be reluctant. ""People use the garden the way they want to use it,"" Mr Martin said. ""It's a really lovely thing and it's great for us, too, because — although we might be giving — we're also receiving because people feel so pleased being a part of it,"" Mr Gilmore said.

103,'Not the life I planned': Suzanne goes to bed early because she can't afford to have her heating on,business,"  Rising electricity prices, cost-of-living pressures pushing Tasmanians to the limit For Tasmanian pensioner Suzanne Cass, making ends meet is so difficult that she rations her food and limits leaving her home. In Tasmania, the average residential power bill will increase by $220 from July 1 The Tasmanian Council of Social Services says the increase comes at the worst time for people already struggling to make ends meet However, the government has announced a winter assistance package to help concession card holders cover some of the increase ""We now only go out when we absolutely have to because of petrol prices and, if we have to go out, we make sure we do more than one thing,"" she said. ""We don't put heating on until four or five o'clock, so the house is quite cold all day, and you go to bed early because you just can't afford the heating."" Her scrimping and saving, made harder by the rising cost of living, is set to go to another level when a 11.88 per cent rise in electricity prices takes effect next month. That rise will see the average annual residential bill rise by about $220, while the average business will pay $176 more. ""It's just one hit after another. It means you can do less,"" Ms Cass said. ""I'm anxious, depressed, worried. It's not the life that I planned … I just never expected at this time in my life that I'd be living like this. ""I used to buy salmon every so often and now I don't do that. ""There's no special treats any more because you just can't do that. Everything you buy, you have to be really careful with and you have to ration it."" Tasmanian Council of Social Services chief executive Adrienne Picone said the increase could not come at a worse time for many Tasmanians. ""We're in the midst of a very severe Tasmanian winter and, added to that, we've got skyrocketing costs — of food, of housing, of petrol — that are really pushing households' budgets to their limit,"" she said. ""We know that, in Tasmania, we have some of the lowest wages in the country and, when we couple that with the rising cost of living, it really means that people are pushed to their limits and really struggling to make ends meet."" The state government has announced a winter assistance package to help people cover the increase. That package will include a $180 discount for eligible electricity concession account holders, $61 of which was already budgeted for. The energy saver loan scheme has also been boosted, offering residential customers, landlords and small businesses an interest-free loan of up to $10,000 to invest in energy-efficient products to lower their electricity bill. However, Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TCCI) chief executive Michael Bailey said the government should announce extra support to help businesses afford the pay rise. ""We recognise that care needs to be taken in intervening in the energy market, to ensure that we can protect consumers as well as providing confidence to investors,"" he said. ""The TCCI is calling on the government to consider carefully targeted assistance to businesses most exposed to price shocks, such as those looking to re-contract at this difficult time.""

104,"Bitcoin value plunges below $US20,000 for first time since 2020 ",business,"  Bitcoin value plunges below $US20,000 for first time since 2020 Bitcoin fell below the psychologically important threshold of $US20,000 ($29,000) on Saturday for the first time since late 2020, in a fresh sign that the sell-off in cryptocurrencies is deepening. The price of the most-popular cryptocurrency had plunged by as much as 12 per cent to less than $US18,100 by late afternoon on the East Coast, according to the cryptocurrency news site CoinDesk. It was November 2020 when bitcoin was last at that level, when it was on its way up to an all-time high of nearly $US69,000, according to CoinDesk. Many in the industry had believed it would not fall under $US20,000. Bitcoin has now lost more than 70 per cent of its value since reaching its peak. Crypto has made some investors overnight millionaires but for others it's a fad propped up by celebrity endorsements. Ethereum, another widely followed cryptocurrency that has been sliding in recent weeks, took a similar tumble on Saturday. The cryptocurrency industry has seen turmoil amid wider turbulence in financial markets. Investors are selling off riskier assets because central banks are raising interest rates to combat quickening inflation. The overall market value of cryptocurrency assets has fallen from $US3 trillion to below $US1 trillion, according to coinmarketcap.com, which tracks crypto prices. On Saturday, the company's data showed crypto's global market value stood at about $US834 billion. A spate of cryptocurrency meltdowns has sparked urgent calls to regulate the freewheeling industry, and last week bipartisan legislation was introduced in the US Senate to regulate the digital assets. The industry has also upped its lobbying efforts — flooding $US20 million into congressional races this year for the first time, according to records and interviews. Cesare Fracassi — a finance professor at the University of Texas at Austin who leads the school's Blockchain Initiative — says bitcoin's fall under the psychological threshold isn't a big deal. Instead, he said, the focus should be on recent news from lending platforms. One of them, Celsius Network, said this month that it was pausing all withdrawals and transfers, with no sign of when it would give its 1.7 million customers access to their funds. Another platform, Babel Finance, said in a notice posted online on Friday that it would suspend redemptions and withdrawals on products due to ""unusual liquidity pressures"". ""There is a lot of turbulence in the market,"" Mr Fracassi said. ""And the reason why prices are going down is because there is a lot of concern the sector is over-leveraged."" The financial fate of many Australians will be decided over the next few days, as the price of many cryptocurrencies plunges and one major crypto-lender locks customers out of their own accounts. Cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase announced on Tuesday that it had laid off about 18 per cent of its workforce, with co-founder and chief executive Brian Armstrong placing some of the blame on a coming ""crypto winter"". Stablecoin Terra imploded last month, losing tens of billions of dollars in value in a matter of hours. Crypto had permeated much of popular culture before its recent tumble, with Super Bowl ads touting the digital assets, while celebrities and YouTube personalities routinely promoted it on social media. David Gerard — a crypto critic and author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain — said the recent meltdowns showed a failure by regulators, who, he said, should have put more scrutiny on the industry years ago. Many nascent investors — especially young people — invested based on a false hope that was sold to them, he said. ""There are real human victims here [who] are ordinary people.""

106,"What energy crisis? WA forges ahead with renewables transition, as others struggle to keep lights on",business,"  WA forges ahead with renewables transition as other states face energy crisis It's been a big week in the world of power — although for different reasons depending on which side of Australia you're on. As much of the country struggles to keep the lights on, WA has taken a significant step in its renewables transition, announcing the end of state-run, coal-fired power plants by 2030. It's expected to have a big impact on household bills in the future, but why is it happening now, and what does it all mean? Here's a rundown of this week's local energy news. The WA government had previously committed to retiring parts of its largest coal-fired plant, the Muja power station. Western Australia will do away with coal power by 2029, leaving the state's electricity hub without its major industry. But this week, we found out what happens next — as it announced plans to close both of the coal-fired plants run by state-owned power provider Synergy by 2030. By phasing out coal-fired power, Synergy estimates its carbon emissions would reduce by 80 per cent by 2030. On top of marking a significant turning point for the nearby coal mining town of Collie, it's a big shift for the state's energy network. To make up for the capacity being lost, the government will spend $3.8 billion over 10 years to add more renewable capacity to the grid. WA's power grid is changing, leaving less room for coal to fit into the mix. Last year alone, about 300 megawatts of rooftop solar power was added to the grid – almost as much as the smaller of the two state-run plants. It means during the day there's little or no need for the coal-fired plants to run, but that causes issues because coal plants aren't designed to be turned on and off. It takes 18 hours for a plant to go from being switched off to fully operational. The government isn't giving a straight answer, but says sticking with coal-fired power would ultimately be more expensive. Premier Mark McGowan said if the coal plants continued to operate, bills would rise by about $1,200 a year by 2030. Instead, he committed to keeping power prices capped in line with inflation until at least 2025. At the same time, the government is also hoping these changes can make Synergy more self-sufficient and less reliant on government grants. Over the next four years, the government is planning to give Synergy $783.3 million in ""financial viability"" subsidies. Effectively, that's money that recognises Synergy doesn't always act like an ordinary business, because there are times when it has to do things for reasons other than financial gain. But it's hoped that by increasing the mix of renewable energy, Synergy's costs will be lower. Some of the capacity will be replaced by renewables already being added to the grid – including rooftop solar. But there still needs to be an ability to provide power when the sun isn't shining, or when there's extra demand. That's why the new projects outlined in this announcement include 800MW of wind capacity and 2,000MWh of storage – including fast-start lithium-ion batteries. In welcome news for the town of Collie, the government is also looking into other technologies, including pumped hydro. When renewable energy is available, it uses that power to pump water up a hill, ""storing"" the energy. Then, when the power is needed, it's allowed to fall back down the hill, through a turbine, which adds power into the grid. But the government isn't locking itself into just these schemes, with Synergy given some latitude in how it invests the $3.8 billion it's receiving. The government is holding out on hydrogen for a little bit longer. ""In the future we would expect hydrogen to be able to replace natural gas, but that's currently not financially viable,"" Energy Minister Bill Johnston said this week. Over the last year, about 31 per cent of the power in the South-West Interconnected System, which covers most of the state's population, was provided by gas, according to the Australian Energy Market Operator. New gas-fired power stations have been ruled out beyond 2030, and the government says it's not likely there would be a need to build any before then. ""But we'll be very cautious in our approach as we move towards 2030, and if we need to take action we will,"" Mr Johnston said. Part of WA's hydrogen future will be centred around the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, north-east of Port Hedland. The government this week announced BP would take a 40.5 per cent stake in the hub, which is planning to generate both wind and solar power, as well as producing green hydrogen. The Premier made clear he was confident this plan would secure WA's energy supply into the future, and the state would avoid the issues being experienced elsewhere. Part of the reason for those issues has been the nature of the electricity market in the east, which is vastly different to WA's state-owned system. Skyrocketing gas prices have also contributed, but WA largely doesn't have to worry about that because of its domestic reservation policy. That policy means 15 per cent of gas reserves within the state's jurisdiction are quarantined for the local market. It's good news, both for now and into the future, with WA planning to rely on gas for more of its base-load power, given it can be fired up in as little as 16 minutes. ""When you have a reservation policy with gas, you can turn gas power stations on immediately,"" Mr McGowan said this week. ""When you have pumped hydro and batteries, the technology now is so good that you can provide base-load power using those mechanisms combined."" A group of academics from all five of WA's universities this week accused the state government of being too close to the gas industry and said closing the coal plants was only part of the solution. ""Their emissions are less than the four alumina refineries that we have in the state and far less than the LNG production facilities that we have in this state,"" Curtin law school academic Hugh Finn said. On the other side of the coin, energy policy specialist Katharine McKenzie said the plan was exciting because it allowed for much more detailed planning than had previously been possible. She said it also made economic sense, given how expensive coal plants were becoming. ""But you also see that that large amount of rooftop solar that's come in, there's a real opportunity to make the most of that and aggregate it so that it acts almost like a power station itself,"" she said. That's the aim of Synergy's Project Symphony, which is trying to work out how the utility can leverage solar panels and batteries to work together more efficiently. Trends within industry are also accelerating the shift away from coal as businesses try to decarbonise, creating even more opportunities, according to Ms McKenzie. ""They're very much looking at replacing their current use of fossil fuel generation with renewable energy, but they're also looking at where they're directly using fossil fuel in their processes, how they can replace that with direct renewable energy as well,"" she said. ""And so coming out of that you have this enormous amount of demand for renewable energy coming in, and that needs to be filled."" It means the private sector is also likely to start coming to the table, now that the government's plan is public. ""So the WA government have said that they will commit $3.8 billion to developing new renewable projects, and potentially pumped hydro,"" Ms McKenzie said. ""There's obviously a role for the private sector as well."" Editor's note (21/6/22): This story has been updated to clarify that gas generated 31 per cent of power to the South-West Interconnected System over the past year, not 25 per cent as originally stated.

107,"Doug weathered the GFC, here’s his advice to other retirees spooked by this month’s stock market dive",business,"  Superannuation losing value in the stock market crash may not be cause for panic, experts say There's increased anxiety amongst some Australian retirees amid a recent plunge on the Australian share market. Margaret and Doug Walsh knew their super would take a hit from the latest downturn. Doug, a former teacher who's been retired for 20 years, says so far his fund has dropped seven per cent. But the couple aren't too concerned, having weathered previous financial storms, including the GFC. ""It's not something I worry about because they always come back, in fact the market gets better with each fall,"" said 77-year-old Doug. It's an attitude that financial experts say is healthy. Their advice is for other retirees to take a leaf out of the Walsh's book. ""While the value of the shares may have fallen, the quality hasn't. And, eventually, values will come back up to reflect the quality of the assets,"" independent financial advisor Nick Bruining explained. Since the RBA lifted rates earlier this month, and amid fears of rising US interest rates, some $270 billion has been wiped off the Australian stock market. As superannuation is closely tied to the share market, that means retirees face chunks taken out of their nest eggs. In fact, this financial year will be only the fifth time in three decades workers will see losses on their superannuation funds. ""There will be some people who are very concerned. I would like to think most people in our age bracket are not relying wholly and solely on the share market,"" said Ron de Grunchy, from the WA Self Funded Retirees association. ""I don't see it as being a major catastrophe — yet. Having said that, who knows where the bottom is going to be,"" he warned. But Bruining is encouraging retirees to hold their ground, no matter how low the ASX falls. ""We're talking about companies with real assets, Woolies, BHP, Commonwealth Bank. Woolies shops are still open for business, BHP still has its iron ore reserves in the ground, the quality is still there and ultimately the price will reflect the quality,"" Bruining said. Margaret Walsh, who is currently National Vice President of the Association of Independent Retirees, believes that knowledge is power. She says a lot of her members have expressed concerns about the current situation, but she encourages them to learn more about how their super is managed. ""The reality is that super goes up and down over cycles and we just have to be patient,"" she said. ""After 11 years of retirement I have a higher balance than what I started with, even after drawing down and even after the impact of COVID,"" Mrs Walsh explained. But that may prove difficult for people to keep in mind as they watch their super slide. Experts say the Australian share market could see further falls, amid the risk of a US recession.

108,Sri Lankans like Dr Kumara are finding unconventional ways to survive. But it may not be enough,business,"  Sri Lanka's economic crisis has turned into a national emergency, and its people are now calling for help to save lives During a brutal shift last year, Sri Lankan doctor Saman Kumara did something he'd never done before — he recorded a desperate voice message asking for help to keep newborn babies alive. Dr Kumara was used to harrowing days working as a neonatologist at one of Colombo's busiest hospitals during the COVID pandemic. But on that day, he realised the country's health system had collapsed to the point that precious lives were at risk. One of Dr Kumara's staff members told him his government hospital was running out of endotracheal tubes, a specialised item for infants. Without these crucial devices, newborn babies with breathing difficulties would die. ""I started shivering and crying,"" he said. ""We had a difficult time during the COVID era, but we could pull through and manage. I never expected or experienced this in my life."" Dr Kumara sent a desperate plea to a group of his former university classmates, asking for donations to replenish the endotracheal tube stocks and help keep babies alive. Within a few hours, that message had gone viral. ""I had thousands and thousands of calls from all over the world and had a couple of sleepless days,"" he said. ""In a few weeks, I got enough endotracheal tubes for the whole country, and I'm still getting stocks."" This is how Dr Kumara and the rest of his hospital now get critical supplies, as Sri Lanka's economic crisis diminishes medical stocks and other basic goods. What started as a political and economic crisis has now turned into a national emergency: supplies for health, food, fuel, and power are all critical. All over Sri Lanka, people like Dr Kumara are coming up with unconventional ways to survive. As medical supplies deplete, they use social media to press for donations. Food is due to run out by September in the capital Colombo, so people are growing vegetables at home to prepare. But these aren't permanent solutions, and politicians warn things are going to get worse. What's happening in Sri Lanka is extraordinary — the unique unravelling of a once-middle-income nation that's dramatically reshaping how people on the ground are living. Pressure is now mounting on Australia to step in to help. In an interview with the ABC, Sri Lanka's new Prime Minister has called on the Australian government to send aid in the form of basic goods like medicine, food and fertiliser. Sri Lankans are feeling the impacts of this crisis everywhere: on aisles at grocery stores, in lines at fuel stations, and at home when the power goes out for hours at a time. The Sri Lankan rupee is now so low in value, and the cost of living escalated so radically, that more and more people cannot afford to buy or access essential items and services. The majority of the country's staples are imported, including medicine, food and fuel. But with the devalued rupee, Sri Lanka can no longer afford to buy them. After years of chaotic fiscal mismanagement by the ruling Rajapaksa family, devastating health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and flow-on effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Sri Lanka has all but run out of foreign reserves. Now the country is hitting breaking point. Many basic goods like fuel run out completely for days at a time, while others, like food, are projected to diminish in a few months. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has just returned to office for a sixth term, was up front about just how bad things would get. ""There's going to be a contraction of the economy and people are going to feel it very, very hard,"" he told the ABC. ""I would like to see that things come to an end by about February — the suffering — but there is a path back."" That means at least nine months of a bad situation getting much worse, according to the Prime Minister's calculations. Months of growing collective frustration led to protesters pushing out previous prime minister Mahinda Rajapaksa in May. They're continuing to call for his brother, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, to stand down as well. For decades, the Rajapaksa family has loomed large on the tropical island nation of Sri Lanka. Their era of dominance could be finally coming to a close. Mr Wickremesinghe, a member of an opposition party, said he took over the role of prime minister because no-one else would take the job. Other opposition members said they would only take the position on numerous conditions, including the President giving up some of his power, something he did not agree to do. ""There was a crisis out on the street, there had to be some governance, there had to be direction, there had to be leadership,"" Mr Wickremesinghe said. ""You have to resurrect the economy … it's a tough challenge but someone had to take it."" But resurrecting the economy is easier said than done, and the Prime Minister has warned things will get worse before they get better. The prospect of a worsening situation is of particular concern to medical professionals, who anticipate catastrophic health impacts if the situation does not improve. Preethi Wijegoonewardene has worked as a GP for more than 40 years. He has managed to support his patients through the crisis until now, but he worries about what's coming next. ""Worst-case scenario, if we don't have the proper treatment, some of our patients will die,"" he said. ""If it comes to it, we have to fight that and somehow get goods from somewhere."" Dr Kumara expects June and July will be the worst. ""We have to struggle, we are expecting a lot of issues,"" he said. ""We are concentrating on the life-saving drugs like cardiac drugs, anti-cancer drugs, and the drugs which are used for ICU patients. ""But from my point of view, at the rate we are being supported by the international organisations and the charities and individuals, I hope we can manage these two months without losing lives."" As well as his regular job of saving newborn babies, Dr Kumara now spends time securing and facilitating medical donations. But it's taking a toll. ""It's very sad, I don't know how many times I cried in the last three or four months because the donors are very sensitive,"" he says. ""Many of the Sri Lankans living overseas, they're very kind-hearted and so many people call me and cry. ""But we are working together as one community to save the country."" Dr Kumara said aid from individuals and charities will not be enough, asserting that foreign governments like Australia need to step in to bring some permanent stability. ""There are a few ways the Australian government can help … in terms of providing medications, as well as consumables, and also funding, because our main problem is foreign currency,"" he said. While access to healthcare products is a crisis in the here and now, the larger-scale problem of food security is looming in the months ahead. There's been a global push for a four-day working week to improve mental wellbeing and productivity. Sri Lanka introduced the concept for government employees on Tuesday, but here, it's a desperate move to give people a day off to grow their own food as supplies run out. ""It seems appropriate to grant government officials leave for one working day of the week and provide them with the necessary facilities to engage in agricultural activities in their backyards,"" a cabinet statement said. The United Nations estimates four out of five people in the country of 22 million are currently forced to skip meals. There are now dire projections that Sri Lanka's capital will run out of food by September. Last year, the Rajapaksa government suddenly banned all chemical fertilisers — another expensive import — in an attempt to push the country towards nationwide organic farming and push down Sri Lanka's import bill. Dying in line for fuel, no paper for exams and hours without power: this is what a day looks like in the tropical nation as Sri Lanka faces its worst economic crisis. The experiment only lasted seven months, but that was enough time to see farmers' crop yields drop and prices dramatically rise. ""There is going to be a shortage of food since we didn't have sufficient fertiliser and we can't depend on food from outside, because [of] the shortage created by the global prices,"" Mr Wickremesinghe told the ABC. ""I feel bad, I feel pretty bad."" Colombo Mayor Rosy Senanayake was shocked to hear in a recent government briefing that Sri Lanka would run out of food in a few months. ""We have about 60,000 flats and apartments where a vast majority of the under-served community lives, and they have little balconies and small spaces,"" she said. ""A technical team is mapping out … how to basically encourage people, give them the necessary tools, give them the seeds, give them incentives to do home gardening."" Nanditha Gamage, a small business owner in Colombo, has been growing her own produce for years, but now it's gone from a hobby to a necessity. ""Luckily Sri Lanka has a very good climate, you can grow vegetables throughout the year,"" she said. ""Anyone can do it … they could use huge pots … but [the government] should actually tell them how to compost first of all, and every house should be given a compost bin and … some technical knowledge."" But Ms Gamage said it's not going to fix the food shortage in the long term. ""It is an option but not a solution as such, because you can grow a few plants … but you have to buy some vegetables from the market, you can't be self-sufficient,"" she said. ""With everyone living in apartments and small houses, they're not so lucky to have a plot where they can grow so many vegetables."" On top of Sri Lanka's local problems, the world is facing a looming food shortage, with Ukraine unable to export essential produce like wheat and maize while it fights Russia. The United Nations estimates at least 5.7 million Sri Lankans now need humanitarian assistance, a number that's set to increase. On Thursday, the United Nations' World Food Programme started distributing ration packs with essentials to vulnerable families, and food vouchers to pregnant women in the poorest parts of Colombo. The Sri Lankan Prime Minister said the country needs $US6 billion from foreign countries to keep the country afloat before supplies completely run out. That figure would cover fuel, food, fertiliser and gas for the next six months. India, China and the US are all looking at helping Sri Lanka, and the country is also talking to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund for bailouts. While Australian and US officials express shock and disappointment over Beijing's deal with Solomon Islands, China has been making inroads across the region for years. But Sri Lanka is still nowhere near that $US6 billion goal. Mr Wickremesinghe said Australia could assist. ""We need medicine, we need food, these are the ways in which Australia can help us,"" he said. ""Fertiliser would be a great help for us. And some food aid to get over the next three critical months, but if we have fertiliser then we will get back into self-sufficiency by February next year."" The crisis is also pushing people to leave the country. In the past month alone, more than 370 Sri Lankans have tried to reach Australia on asylum seeker boats, and the Sri Lankan Immigration Department has been overwhelmed with almost 300,000 requests for passports. In an extraordinary move, the Sri Lankan government has also said any public sector worker who wants to live abroad for work can get five years of unpaid leave and it won't affect their position or pension. It's an attempt to get workers into foreign jobs so they can send currency back to Sri Lanka. Mr Wickremesinghe called on Australia to let some of those people in. ""Encourage more young Sri Lankans to come and study in Australia,"" he said. ""Some of them may stay in Australia, others will come back, but that's another way of building a future. ""Because the education system has got disrupted … so, let's see some way in which they can be helped to get into Australia and study, I would like that."" More than 300 Sri Lankans have tried to get to Australia in the past few weeks as the country's economic crisis has worsened. The Australian Coalition government pledged $2.5 million to Sri Lanka in food aid in April, but the new Labor government is yet to announce further assistance. It’s expressed deep concern about the situation in Sri Lanka. But Foreign Minister Penny Wong's office did not respond to the ABC's questions on whether the government would provide aid and extra places for students as requested by the country’s Prime Minister. The United Nations is calling for $66.6 million to meet urgent humanitarian needs, and the Australian Council for International Development (ACFID) has urged the Australian Government to contribute $10 million of that figure. ""This is the time for Australia and its Quad partners to step up and help a fellow Indo-Pacific country that is in great need,"" ACFID chief executive Marc Purcell said. ""It's important for humanitarian reasons, but also geostrategic reasons — otherwise we face the prospect of China stepping into the breach."" As the rest of the world grapples with economic insecurity, including Australia, where there are threats of a recession, Sri Lanka's Prime Minister has a stark warning for leaders. ""Tell the truth to the people of how the economy functions,"" Mr Wickremesinghe said. ""Don't do populist politics which will damage the economy."" Sri Lankans are used to being resilient. They've endured decades of civil war, a recent terror attack, and the devastating impacts of the global pandemic, but the country has continually bounced back. Now Sri Lankans, like Colombo hospital director Pradeep Wijesinghe, can only hope they'll overcome this crisis too. ""Lord Buddha said, 'everything is temporary'. I hope this situation is also temporary,"" he said.

109,NSW Premier defends Barilaro's appointment as US trade envoy amid claims of 'jobs for mates',business,"  NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet defends John Barilaro's appointment as US trade envoy amid claims of 'jobs for mates' The appointment of former deputy premier John Barilaro as NSW trade commissioner to the US has been defended by the Premier amid criticism it is another case of ""jobs for mates"". Mr Barilaro's new role was announced on Friday and came after a ""rigorous global talent search"" by recruitment firm NGS Global, according to a statement by the state government. His posting is among six trade posts around the world tasked with spruiking the state's investment opportunities and local businesses— at a cost of about $55 million according to NSW Labor. Leader Chris Minns was quick to criticise the decision, branding it a ""$400,000-a-year job for a friend"". Earlier on Saturday, Premier Dominic Perrottet said the former Nationals leader was the best person for the job. ""It doesn't come as any surprise to me that the independent process that occurred, that he was by far the most outstanding candidate,"" he said. ""And recommended by that panel to the government and I'm sure he will do a brilliant job."" Mr Barilaro, who resigned late last year just days after former premier Gladys Berejiklian, played a role in setting up international trade initiative Global NSW. It was this experience and his skill set that Mr Perrottet said would make him a strong advocate for the state — at a time when it needed to be more ""aggressive"". ""When I went to London in my former role as treasurer … we weren't at the back of the room. We weren't even in the room when it came to driving investment into our state,"" he said. ""The deputy premier in his former role was instrumental in setting that up and our direction going forward."" Mr Minns found the announcement ""perplexing"" from a government committed to change and proclaiming it was not stale after 11 years in power. ""The same old Liberal Party and the National Party jobs for the boys, jobs for the mates, looking after their own before the interests of the people of New South Wales,"" he said. ""We're genuinely expected to believe that a global search took place, effectively bringing in people from around the world to determine who's best to represent the interests of this state and the answer all along was John Barilaro?"" He also said a government seeking another term in office needed to do better given the current climate of inflation, staff shortages and concerns over wages. ""Teachers or nurses are leaving the profession in droves because they've been told repeatedly by the Premier of New South Wales that there isn't enough money to … make life a little easier on the frontline of our public services.,"" Mr Minns said. ""And yet there's more than enough money to make sure that jobs are available for friends of Mr Perrottet."" In accepting his appointment, Mr Barilaro — who recently settled his defamation case against Google — said he would continue to build on what had already been achieved. ""I'm looking forward to supporting NSW companies to export and expand to the United States,"" he said. ""Including the many fintech, cyber security, space, health and food and beverage companies. ""We are already helping to succeed in the US through the Going Global Export Program."" Former national chief executive of the Australia-China Business Council Helen Sawczak was also appointed to the role of Senior Trade and Investment Commissioner to Greater China. It is expected Mr Barilaro and Ms Sawczak will relocate to commence their new jobs in the coming months.

110,Foetal calf blood hits record $615 a litre,business,"  Foetal calf blood hits record $615 a litre as research labs secure crucial commodity It is one of the lesser known by-products of Australia's cattle industry, but its value is on the rise and has more than doubled since 2019. Foetal calf blood, which is mostly used in medical research and pharmaceutical industries, has this month reached a record price of $615 a litre, ex-abattoir. Mecardo analyst Adrian Ladaniwskyj said supply of the commodity was tight and the record price was an indicator of Australia's cattle herd rebuilding after years of drought. ""The ongoing, strong foetal calf blood market indicates that cattle producers are holding onto their females,"" he said. ""The amount of cows getting sent to abattoirs in Australia has reduced, and as a result of less cows getting slaughtered there's less calf serum getting produced, so the price goes up."" Cattle producers do not gain financially from the rising value of foetal bovine serum (FBS), but abattoirs do. Essentially it is a lucrative surprise for abattoirs when a foetus shows up in the processing. ""Most of the time it's a bit of an accident that some of these cows have gone to the processors and are pregnant,"" Mr Ladaniwskyj said. Weekly national slaughter data from Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) shows that in May the ratio of female cattle getting slaughtered fell to just 36 per cent, compared to 45 per cent the same time last year and 52 per cent in May 2020. Principal virologist at the Berrimah Veterinary Laboratory in Darwin, Dr Richard Weir, works with foetal bovine serum almost on a daily basis. ""It can be used in universities, vaccine manufacturers need it, and here in Darwin we use FBS for a range of cell cultures to isolate viruses for our diagnostic or research purposes,"" he said. ""To carry out [biosecurity] surveillance here in Darwin, which is important to the whole country, we need to grow cell cultures. ""To have the foetal bovine serum is imperative to grow those cultures."" Dr Weir said in recent years labs had been paying $800-$1,200 a litre for FBS. ""This news [of record ex-abattoir prices] hasn't filtered through to us, but we aren't looking to buy a batch at the moment,"" he said. ""We bought a 100-litre batch about five years ago and we're roughly half way through it. So in probably the next 12 or 24 months we'll be looking to buy a new batch."" Adrian Ladaniwskyj said Australian FBS sold for a premium because of the cattle industry's disease-free status. He said with abattoirs struggling with high cattle prices and rising input costs, the sale of FBS would be helping their bottom line. ""There's a positive story here because not only is it used for a noble cause — where what could have been a waste-product is used in medical research to better people's lives — at the same time it's providing a bit of extra cash flow for processors [abattoirs] who are doing it quite tough at the moment.""

111,Devil in the details: Why these marsupials have swapped the Apple Isle for the tropical north ,business,"  Tasmanian devils sent to Far North Queensland as part of effort to help save species from facial tumour disease Far North Queensland may be an unusual location for a mammal that usually lives among the snow-capped peaks of Tasmania, but Rainforestation in Kuranda has just taken possession of three male Tasmanian devil joeys. Even though they are thousands of kilometres from Tasmania, the joeys are playing their part in the conservation of one of Australia’s most vulnerable mammals. Wildlife team leader at Rainforestation David Kelly said that the joeys can adapt to the tropics. “The three joeys were born in captivity in Western Plains Zoo in Dubbo.” he said. “They are brothers, and they had their first birthday at the end of March, so they are young and vibrant and full of energy. “We have plenty of ways for them to keep cool including fans, mist and ponds, which they love playing in.” The three joeys are part of program that is hoping to replenish the species' numbers after the emergence of devil facial tumour disease (DFTD), which was discovered in 1996. Once the cancer has become visible, it is almost always fatal. It has been estimated the Tasmanian devil population declined by as much as 80-90 per cent since the discovery of the disease. “They are part of a breeding program currently running in captive facilities around Australia to help protect and conserve the devils who have had a pretty tough time over the past few decades,” Mr Kelly said. “At one stage we were looking at a 100 per cent mortality rate, but slowly we have started to reverse that decline.” Mr Kelly said Far North Queensland was favourable due to its isolation. “When the captive breeding program was set up it was important that captive devils were isolated from one another so that if disease got into a captive population, we didn’t lose all the populations,” he said. According to the Australasian Species Management Program (ASMP) studbook; “It requires certain animals to breed in order to maintain diversity of the captive population. Breeding is controlled by removing all males from social groupings, prior to the onset of submissive behaviour, in early March.” “All captive Tasmanian devils have had their DNA mapped which is then stored and used later for the captive breeding program,” Mr Kelly said. “The studbook keeper has a list of every captive devil in Australasia, and they make breeding recommendations to zoos. “One day we may get a call saying one of your boys would be a good match for a female devil down south, so we would send him there to breed.” Dr Carolyn Hogg from the University of Sydney is also the co-lead of the Australasian Wildlife Genomics group, and she says that genes and captive populations are the key to saving the Tasmanian Devil from extinction. “The Menzies Medical Research Institute in Tasmania is making great headway getting a working vaccine for FTD,” she said. “But in the interim that is why we have the insurance population and other measures to keep Tasmanian devils from disappearing.” Dr Hogg said that wild populations of Tasmanian devils were at about 90 per cent below what they were before 1996. “There are only two disease-free areas in Tasmania,“ Dr Hogg said. “The captive breeding program was essential when we didn’t know much about the disease in the early 2000s “Since then, we do know a lot more about the disease, but we haven’t been able to eradicate it in the wild.” “Devils are now living in much smaller populations, so they are now more susceptible to other threatening processes such as dogs, roadkill and small population pressures,” Dr Hogg said. “That is why keeping an insurance population is still important.” While Far North Queensland may not be the traditional home of Tasmanian devils, Dr Hogg said that every small population helps. “There are lots of zoos around the country that are more than willing to help and be part of the insurance program,” she said. “These zoos are provided to committing space and opportunities, so that we can house some devils before moving them back for breeding. She said it was a great opportunity for the people of Far North Queensland to see a devil and ""be educated about what is happening"". ""Not just to devils but to a lot of native species and the declines that have been caused by different threatening processes.” We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

112,"New SA rental price statistics show just how much, and where it's costing more",business,"  New rental price statistics show 20 per cent increase in SA, with Murray Bridge a hotspot Private rental prices have shot up 20 per cent in the past two years in South Australia, according to new figures from the SA Housing Authority. Rents have particularly increased in towns south of Adelaide and in Murray Bridge, according to the data gathered from bonds submitted with Consumer and Business Services. While not as high, rental increases are more consistent in the Adelaide metropolitan area, with rent in every postcode increasing over the past two years. Across the state, the average house rental has increased from $350 to $420 for leases starting in January–March 2022 compared with two years earlier. The number of houses available has dropped from 10,245 per quarter to 7,760. Among the highest increases have been in towns south of Adelaide, such as Willunga, Myponga, Sellicks Beach and Clarendon, where rents have gone up by between 40 and 67 per cent, depending on the location. Julie Parsons, a property manager based in McLaren Vale, said the increase was due to high demand for properties to buy — including from interstate people able to work from home — and low supply. She said the area offered a country lifestyle while not being far from Adelaide or Victor Harbor. ""A lot of landlords have been selling so tenants have had to vacate,"" she said. Single mother of four Kirsty Rich was one of those tenants. She had to leave her home of six years in Aldinga Beach and was homeless for three months last year — couch-surfing and using motels — before finding a place about 45 kilometres away. ""It can happen to anybody now. Everybody who rents is uneasy,"" she said She spent all her time looking for a new rental and had to move her children to a new school. ""It was so awful,"" she said. She has bought land near where she is living now — thanks to help with the deposit from her parents and from an ABC Radio Adelaide listener — but faces eviction from her home again, with the new landlord looking to sell. It could take up to 12 months to move into her new home from her rental, due to delays in council approvals and getting work started. ""It's taken me 12 months to find my ground again and I'm looking at the prospect of six to 12 months not knowing where [I'm] going to be,"" Ms Rich said. While the largest rent increases were in the small towns of Stansbury, Quorn and Andamooka, the highest increase for a major town was in Murray Bridge — at almost 70 per cent. It now costs $450 a week on average to rent a house in the town 75 kilometres south-east of Adelaide, compared with $265 in January–March 2020. Murray Bridge Mayor Brenton Lewis said it was a matter of ""supply and demand"" with the town's economy thriving after setbacks such as the Thomas Foods abattoir fire in 2018. He said the town's population of 23,000 was growing and would one day overtake Whyalla and Mount Gambier. ""There's not enough rentable accommodation across a range of types of accommodation,"" he said. ""It's a good thing and a bad thing … People are starting to realise it's a very liveable place. ""It's not that far from the city and we have a lot of employment — a lot of it is in the food processing industry but not all of it."" He is hopeful with new developments around the corner and building supply issues easing, the situation can be eased within 12 months. Shane Maddocks, the chief executive of ac.care — the homelessness gateway service in Murray Bridge — said rents were simply becoming unaffordable for people on benefits or low incomes. With everything from mortgage rates to grocery prices and energy bills going up, more Australians are under financial pressure. We want to hear how it's impacting you. ""So we're seeing more people in housing stress than ever before and we're seeing increasing support needs for food and other services,"" he said. According to the SA Housing Authority, there were only 15 vacant public housing properties in the town in 2021, out of 630 owned by the state government, while another 10 were untenantable. With private rentals going up, Mr Maddocks said fewer people could now afford to leave public housing, so no vacancies were opening. ""But we've also got people fully employed often on reasonable incomes who can't find rental properties,"" he said. Apart from some rural areas, only Gawler and Angle Vale had rental decreases, due to a large number of houses coming on to the market in the commuter towns north of Adelaide. Rents for units shrunk 7 per cent in the Adelaide CBD, with fewer international students looking for apartments. The most expensive postcode to rent in South Australia is 5065, which includes the suburbs of Dulwich, Glenside, Linden Park, Toorak Gardens and Tusmore, immediately south-east of the Adelaide CBD, at $700 per week.

113,Expecting a property price correction? Not in the rural sector ,business,"  Australian agricultural land tipped to hold its value amid economic downturn The price of agricultural land has never been higher and despite the current economic turmoil, analysts and agents believe it will continue to hold its value. Rural land valuer Tim Lane said high commodity prices plus a good season in many areas were two factors behind the record levels, in some cases up to 30 per cent more than previous prices for the past three years. ""We've said this before that people have experienced circa 100 per cent increase in the value of their assets in the last three or four years, with a trend line of low-interest rates, commodity outlook, good seasons, and all the positives that have really boiled the market up to where we are now,"" he said. The ABC has reported high prices paid for farmland across all production types with the sale of the mixed cropping Goondiwindi farm South Callandoon understood to have sold for $100 million last year and gulf country cattle station Miranda Downs selling for well above $160 million last June. Mr Lane, a national client manager of agribusiness with Herron Todd White, said he did not expect the forecast economic downturn to cause any big dips in the market. ""Agriculture is a long game, as everybody knows,"" Mr Lane said. ""So, it won't react as sharp as say the share market or indeed some of the residential commercial markets, which are very much more sensitive to interest rates."" He said the good financial position of farmers looking to buy more land meant prices should remain high and would not automatically adjust like other sectors. ""The outlook and the balance sheets of the majority of clients are very strong, they've had very good capital gain, they've got good cash flows, the seasons are running well, for the majority of people around the country,"" he said. Principal at C1 Realty, Danny Bukowski, said demand was high for rural properties, particularly in southeast Queensland. ""We have a shortage of properties coming on the market at present [and] when we list a new property, we have a large amount of inquiry,"" he said. ""For example, we have a chicken and irrigation property for sale and have had approximately 49 inquiries."" ""Demand is strong, Brisbane and the Gold Coast are only one hour away (from Beaudesert) so demand for rural/lifestyle properties is extremely high because of the location and shortage of good land."" Mr Lane said he did not believe the current economic climate would impact demand in the rural market. But it may just take some of the frenzy out of the market. ""What it might do is take a bit of the FOMO (fear of missing out) out of the market early and some of that urgency to buy, and it may mean some longer-term due diligence,"" he said. While commentators have pointed to historically low interest rates over the past four years as a contributing factor behind the rural land boom, they do not expect rising rates to slow demand. NAB senior interest rate strategist Ken Crompton said the cash rate was expected to continue to climb, particularly with soaring inflation. ""We expect the RBA is going to lift the cash rate by another 50 basis points in July, and other 50 basis points again in August and then another smaller hike again before the end of the year, which should put the cash rate somewhere around 2.1 per cent,"" he said. But he said Australia's rates would remain relatively low in absolute terms. ""It's still a relatively bullish outlook, and if we get raised to 2.1 per cent that probably supports a stable outlook rather than implying something significant"" he said. ""Particularly if inflation globally is starting to come off, then you may find that the rates don't have to rise too much more from then and the end of our forecast period in 2024.""

114,How an ill-timed stunt involving a Viennetta ice cream brought down one of China's richest influencers,business,"  China's Lipstick King Austin Li was a rich influencer adored by Beijing officials. One mistake triggered his downfall For Austin Li's millions of fans, the evening of June 3 started like any of his other live stream sales events on Taobao, the biggest e-commerce platform in China. On this particular night, he was selling an ice cream believed to be Viennetta, an iconic and beloved Australian sweet. As traffic peaked on the live stream, Li's staff member presented the ice cream adorned with what appeared to be five Oreo cookies, a Ferrero chocolate and a chocolate roll. The cake was curiously shaped like an armoured tank. As Li's co-host took the plate from the staff, Li looked at the cake, smiling. All of a sudden, the stream was switched off. As fans waited for it to be reconnected, Li posted an apology on Chinese social media Weibo, claiming the team was ""having a technical issue."" He then made another post, announcing the termination of the live event. That was the last time Li's fans heard from him. What Li and his fans didn't know at the time was that the sweet, creamy tank-like ice cream cake had triggered Beijing's special censorship system tailored for the 1989 Tiananmen Square anniversary on June 4. China's Government is extremely sensitive to any allusion to the iconic image of a man standing in front of a column of tanks during the student-led protest movement. To this day, the photo — and anything referring to the massacre that followed — is banned in China. Now all of Li's fans are waiting to see if he re-emerges later tonight. He is scheduled to appear in one of the three annual big e-commerce sales in China on June 18. But even though he is a lucrative salesman — once selling $2.2 billion in a single stream — experts say it's unlikely that Li will appear in public for a while. Austin Li earned himself the nickname ""the Lipstick King"" after he broke live stream records by selling 15,000 lipsticks in five minutes. His sales prowess made him a big star for Taobao, an Amazon-like online shopping platform owned by Alibaba that allows people to buy everything from household gadgets to cosmetics. In 2018, Li went head-to-head with Jack Ma, who was the founder of Alibaba, in a lipstick-selling stunt. Li sold 1,000, while Ma only sold 10. It seemed like a meteoric rise for the 30-year-old, who dropped out from university during his final year of dance studies. But the Lipstick King insists he did not achieve success overnight. In an interview with Chinese media, Li said he started his career as a salesperson for cosmetic products. He noticed many female customers were hesitant to try the lipstick testers at the counter, so he started to apply the products himself to model the colours. Li's unique approach made him the store's top salesman, and he soon gained attention from online influencer agencies. In 2016, Li won a competition of beauty influencers, and he made his debut online. Li made his debut the same year that Alibaba launched its live streaming platform, Taobao Live. The service encourages shoppers to buy while watching influencers spruiking the products during live streams. Shoppers could also enjoy limited discount offers during the broadcast. 2016 was also the year that China's internet users dramatically expanded compared to the previous three years, with 43 million users online. The e-commerce live streaming platform has also become a lifesaver for China's private tutoring sector. The government cracked down on the industry last year to ease financial pressure on parents. But private English tutors now simply host their lessons via live streams. Dr Samuel Kwok, an associate professor in online luxury brand management at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, said Li bridged the gap between e-commerce giants, brands and ordinary internet users. He said Li's success was also the result of the growing power of young educated women who can afford entry-level luxury brands, and are willing to spend money on themselves. ""[Li] is very successful in targeting the mass [audience], particularly the ladies from late-20s to 40-something,"" said Professor Kwok. Li was also aware of his fan base. In each live stream, he would not only address his audiences as ""sisters"", but also tried the products himself. ""Oh my god! Buy it!"" he would often exclaim. Li's skyrocketing popularity and his reputation as a hardworking businessman soon attracted attention from the ruling Chinese Communist Party. Authorities, who denounced the growing trend of ""lying flat"" among young people amid intense work pressures last year, admired his work ethic. Last year, Shanghai's city government awarded Li a May 4th Medal, a party-backed honour for young people that acknowledges their ""[contribution] to the development of the country"". Li also participated in Chinese state media-run propaganda shows, and was an ambassador for a social media campaign to promote the country's highest national prosecution agency. But now, his bright future is on the brink — all because of an ice cream cake. In the past five years, Li has rarely missed a daily live stream. While his name could still be searched on China's social media, the photo of him holding the tank-like cake has been censored on Weibo, China's largest social media platform. Several hashtags related to Li were also limited during the week of June 4. Eric Liu, a former social media censor for Weibo and now a free speech advocate in the US, said the censorship that Li experienced is a ""normal reaction"" from the platform over the 1989 Tiananmen protests. ""There is a very strict censorship system especially about Tiananmen protests,"" said Mr Liu. ""Firstly, if you post something that can be related to Tiananmen, such as a candle emoji between the night of June 3 and June 5, the post will be removed, and your account will be suspended."" Some Chinese activists also try to use a random number combination that could indicate ""8964"" — the date of Tiananmen Square massacre, to avoid censorship. But Mr Liu said even if the platforms fail to understand the meaning of such a post, they would still censor it and suspend the account to avoid any slips through the net. According to Mr Liu, most platforms still rely on manual censors, supported by algorithms, to track down the sensitive words or images. He said up to one month prior to June 4, censors would not be allowed to take any annual or sick leave, while their weekends would be shortened. ""This is to ensure they have enough staff to censor content relevant to June 4,"" he said, adding that censored content might be given to police as reference for arrest. While Beijing has pushed platforms to undertake strict censorship to snuff out discussion of the Tiananmen protests, the censorship against Li has sparked waves of curiosity among young Chinese people, many of whom were born after the tragedy. On June 4, after Li's live stream sale was pulled, some users inquired about Tiananmen in his online discussion groups, with some mentioning they had used VPN to do the search. Many of these posts were censored. Mr Liu believed the Lipstick King was not aware that the tank-like cake could trigger the censorship about Tiananmen. He said there have been similar incidents where businesses posted ""what's the date today?"" on June 4 and were immediately censored. Dr Rose Lüqiu, an assistant journalism professor at Hong Kong Baptist University and a veteran journalist reporting on China, said it is unclear whether the censorship against Li was initiated by the platforms themselves or the government. ""[Li's disappearance] is the consequence of censorship, because nobody knows what's the red line, nobody wants to take the risk, especially for the platforms,"" she said. China's patriotic education is one of the country's most successful propaganda campaigns, producing hundreds of thousands of young patriots over the years. Professor Lüqiu said Li might still have hopes to make a comeback. Unlike artists such as Hong Kong singer Denise Ho whose account was suspended on Weibo due to her pro-democracy political stance, Li's account was still there. His previous content was still searchable on many platforms. Even if Li overcomes this scandal, other challenges could lie ahead. The massive profits of the live stream sale sector have recently caught Beijing's attention. Last year, China issued a $21 million fine to Viya, the second most-popular live streamer after Li, over alleged tax evasion. Li may also face potential backlash from his younger fans if he returns, said Professor Lüqiu. ""I think people in China, especially the younger generation, are used to the censorship system,"" she said. ""If someone disappears, some of [the young people] would consider [that] they did something wrong. ""And they would find someone else to substitute [the person who disappeared]. New people would appear, and I think they would find their new interest.""

115,Joel nearly had a house deposit in crypto. Now most of it's gone after the crash,business," Science Cryptocurrency price crash a result of inflation, as investors lose their life savings Over five years of fly-in, fly-out mining work in Far North Queensland, Joel had saved up almost enough for a first-home deposit. Then, about six months ago, the price of bitcoin began a long decline. Now he's lost most of his savings — and this week his luck got even worse. The company that manages his cryptocurrency in exchange for rewards has frozen withdrawals for all its customers, meaning Joel can't even access his money. ""Before the prices dropped, it was starting to look like a house,"" the 24-year-old electrician said. Joel is one of many Australians whose financial fate will be decided over the next few days, after the price of bitcoin plunged about 30 per cent in the past week, shaking confidence and raising fears of further declines. On popular Australian cryptocurrency Facebook groups, moderators have posted links to counselling hotlines. ""There's a lot of very distressed people,"" said Luke Torsello, moderator of Crypto Australia Facebook group, with 99,000 members. ""Everyone is in damage control at the moment."" Inflation, said Chris Berg, co-director of RMIT's Blockchain Innovation Hub. Central banks around the world increasing interest rates to combat inflation has led to investors pulling out of what are called ""risk assets"", or assets with a high degree of private volatility. ""Crypto is the ultimate risk asset, so it's the first to fall,"" Dr Berg said. This has come as a surprise to some. Cryptocurrencies had been promoted in some quarters as a ""hedge against inflation"", meaning they would hold or increase in value as inflation went up. It hasn't worked out that way. ""Bitcoin is not an inflation hedge,"" Dr Berg said. ""As crypto becomes integrated with the economy, it becomes responsive to economy-wide macro shocks."" The combined market value of all cryptocurrencies is now reportedly less than $US1 trillion ($1.43 trillion), or about a third of its November value. So that's about $US2 trillion ($2.86 billion) wiped off cryptocurrency in just over half a year. As the price falls, investors are getting jittery. Last month, Terra, which had been one of the world's most valuable and stable digital currencies, crashed in value, losing 95 per cent of its value in 48 hours and triggering a widespread loss of confidence. A month later, this has created trouble for Joel's crypto-lender, Celsius. About six months ago, Joel deposited the crypto he had accumulated over the past five years in a crypto savings account operated by the US-based company Celsius, founded in 2017. Celsius was set up to be a bit like a bank, but promised much higher interest rates of up to 18 per cent per year. It said it was able to pay such high rates through making long-term loans and earning even larger returns. This may have sounded too good to be true, but plenty of people jumped at the opportunity. As of May this year, Celsius had 1.7 million users and close to $US12 billion $17.17 billion) in assets under management. The business model worked fine while the market was strong. But when Terra crashed spectacularly last month, rumours spread that Celsius would face a liquidity crisis, meaning it would not have the cash for customers to make their withdrawals. An old-fashioned bank run ensued: Customers rushed to withdraw their money. At the time, Celsius chief executive officer Alex Mashinsky dismissed the collapse of confidence as ""FUD"", or fear, uncertainty and doubt. But the very next day, on Monday in Australia, Celsius abruptly announced it was ""pausing all withdrawals"". Joel was caught unawares. ""It's most of my net worth,"" he said. Theo, a 32-year-old from Sydney working in logistics and freight-forwarding, has most of his savings locked up in Celsius. ""It kind of feels like my money is being held hostage,"" he said. He was also saving up for a first-home deposit, as well as an engagement ring. It's not clear what will happen to Celsius, what the company's plan is to remedy the situation, or whether customers will get their money back. The company's CEO, Alex Mashinsky, broke a three-day silence on Thursday. What happens next partly depends on several unknowns, including where Celsius has invested its customer's money, and how much money it had previously set aside to be available for customer withdrawals. We don't know these things because, though it's like a bank, Celsius isn't regulated as a bank, which is required to have a certain amount of capitalisation (ie. money set aside for customer withdrawals). ""We don't know the position of Celsius,"" Dr Berg said. ""We don't know if it's gone bust and it may well not have — there's all sorts of rumours going around."" Now the regulators are closing in. State security boards in four US states have reportedly launched probes into Celsius. On page like Crypto Australia, a common refrain to the Celsius news has been ""Not your keys, not your coins"", meaning those who have apparently lost money shouldn't have stored their coins with a centralised exchange or company that can get hacked, or otherwise go under. In 2014, hackers stole more than $US660 million ($945 million) of users' funds from the world's largest exchange, Mt Gox. ""I'm from the Mt Gox days so I've learned my lesson, 'Not your keys, not your crypto,'"" said Crypto Australia's Luke Torsello. Newer members were learning it for the first time, Mr Torsello said. ""When you hear about people who have lost everything, you feel like slapping them and hugging them at the same time."" Crypto has made some investors overnight millionaires but for others it's a fad propped up by celebrity endorsements. One in nine Australians have bought cryptocurrencies in the past year, according to Consumer advocacy group Choice. For years, bitcoin and other currencies have boomed, fuelling an investment culture of wild speculation. Stories of young investors going ""all in"" and making it rich have inspired a generation who are struggling with the high cost of living, unaffordable housing, and stagnant wage growth. Now, dreams of crypto riches appear to be crashing down. Joel invested in crypto because he felt he couldn't get ahead otherwise. ""It comes down to the fact that housing is unaffordable, so what else is there? ""I don't want to hold my wealth in cash."" Karl, a young Australian with most of his savings totaling thousands of dollars locked up in Celsius, said the same. ""It seems like a never-ending battle when you look at the cost of living, wage stagnation, cost of food, cost of fuel, and inflation. ""I don't want cash sitting in a bank account because with inflation, you're earning 0.5 per cent interest. You just can't win."" Celsius's troubles will strengthen calls for regulation, Dr Berg said. ""The movement for consumer protection, especially with centralised companies like exchanges, will no doubt become more salient as a result,"" he said. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) recently laid out a policy roadmap for regulating financial entities engaging in activity with crypto-assets and aims to implement this by 2025. The devastating effects of the crash of crypto ""stablecoins"" Terra and Luna are being felt by many but their crash may have been orchestrated in one massive piece of ethically questionable trading. Meanwhile, the crypto crash could get a lot worse. Previous downturns in 2013 and 2017 saw the price fall more than 80 per cent from then-record highs. So far, bitcoin is down about 70 per cent from its November 2021 high. Either way, Dr Berg said the fall won't shake the foundations of crypto like previous downturns, when the technology was less widely used. ""In the long-term, crypto as a technology, blockchain as a technology, as an infrastructure for financial assets — that's locked in now. ""It's a normal part of the economy.""

117,analysis: Why superannuation losses will be worse than we think,business,"  Why superannuation losses are likely to be worse than we think after horror year on global markets Even before last week's market conflagration, the scene was looking ugly. While it may have come as a shock to many, superannuation balances — which ballooned last year through the worst recession in more than a century — had already dipped into the red by late last month just as the financial year was drawing to a close. After last week's gravity pull from rising interest rates, the rout on global stock markets has turned that bleak prospect into a painful reality. Best now to mentally prepare for a significant decline in your retirement savings when that June 30 statement hits the inbox. Even those who have erred on the side of caution — with a more-conservative superannuation option — are likely to see significant declines. The only ones who will be spared are those with the foresight — or good luck — to switch to cash at the beginning of the year. Until last week, it somehow had appeared that global monetary authorities had managed to engineer a major downturn on financial markets — without the usual accompaniment of panic and despair. No more. A mood of despondency has settled over financial markets and — unlike previous downturns — there appears to be little room to hide. Everything of late has been falling. That's made life extremely difficult for investors, home-spun and professional alike. And it's likely to continue. After more than 30 years of declining interest rates and minimal inflation, the world seems poised to enter a new era — or maybe re-enter an old one — of sluggish growth, escalating costs and more expensive capital. It's a world that many investors have never before experienced. Australia has been an outlier on the global stage this year. While Wall Street has been grinding lower since January, higher commodity prices — courtesy of Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine — have kept financial markets news off the front pages here. Until now. After Australians collectively took a bath in the wash-up from the global financial crisis, our big superannuation funds reviewed their investment strategies. Most figured out they had way too much invested in Australian shares, that their portfolios were too closely tied to the local stock market. So, they actively diversified into offshore shares, property, infrastructure, bonds and other alternative assets in a bid to reduce the volatility of your fund's performance. The idea was that, if the bottom falls out of one asset class, it should be offset by others that perform well. Even after that realignment, however, a normal balanced fund would have about 20 per cent of your savings invested in the local market. Luckily, that bias was working well until April because our stock market was shrugging off the global woes. Most other assets, however, were doing rather badly and, unusually, all at once. The sudden re-emergence of inflation — and the drastic rate hikes from central bankers to tame it — temporarily junked the theory around diversification. And, now, local stocks have joined the plunge. International shares, which make up about 30 per cent of most superannuation portfolios, have been on the slide since Christmas. If you've been stunned by the sudden drop in our market last week — which has helped shave 15 per cent from April's peak — consider this. Wall Street is down 23 per cent since January. The technology-heavy Nasdaq, which has driven the stellar performance on Wall Street for more than a decade, is off 32 per cent. As for cryptocurrency, well, don't even go there. At last glance, the entire market was in chaos, with overall losses now more than 70 per cent from the peak. This may come as a shock, but the driving force behind all investments is not the stock market. It is bond markets. Essentially, bonds are IOUs. Both governments and corporations issue them when they raise debt, usually with the promise of a set interest or coupon rate for a given period of time, say 10 years. Once issued, they are traded on open markets that dwarf stock markets. Vast trillions of dollars are invested in them, and the sheer weight of that money makes them the foundation, the bedrock that dictates performance in everything, from interest rates to property, stocks and currencies. In fact, Bill Clinton's advisor, James Carville — the man who famously coined the phrase ""It's the economy, stupid"" — is just as famous for this line: ""I used to think that, if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the President or the Pope. But now I want to be the bond market because you can intimidate everybody."" The past year has been truly intimidating. It has been the worst year on record for US government bonds, with losses of 12 per cent. To put that into context, the second-worst year was 1984, when they shed 2.9 per cent. Because governments rarely default, bonds are considered to be risk-free. That's why they attract so much money and so much attention. For the past 40 years, as interest rates have declined, they have delivered huge gains. Being risk-free, however, doesn't mean you can't lose money on them as many big professional funds managers suddenly have discovered. There's an inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices. If punters think rates will fall, they bid up bond prices. And that's been the one-way bet for more than 40 years. Suddenly, however, everything has been thrown into reverse. So, what does this have to do with you? You've got US bonds in your superannuation fund portfolio. In any balanced fund, about 10 per cent of your savings are in what's known as fixed-interest investments. Because they are — or at least were —considered to be relatively safe, there are fewer of them in higher-risk options such as growth funds. But, if you have opted for safer alternatives such as a stable or conservative option, around a quarter of your investment is sitting in bonds … which have been shaken and stirred. Ask five different economists and you'll get 10 different answers. On the one hand … However, it is difficult to see any quick market recovery any time soon. The surge in stock prices that rapidly followed the crash in February 2020 came about because central banks, led by the US Federal Reserve, not only slashed interest rates to zero, they also printed money like there was no tomorrow. Global financial markets have taken a hit lately, and super has been caught up in the turmoil. Should you be worried? They'd been doing it for a decade — ever since the GFC wreaked havoc — and it hadn't even looked like firing-up inflation. So, during the pandemic, central banks — including our very own RBA — jumped in on the action. In the past few years, each time the Fed tried to withdraw some of that printed cash, stocks tanked and the Fed nervously retreated. Now, with inflation on the march, it has no option. It is going to start aggressively pulling that cash back out to take the heat out of the economy. And, since the pandemic pump, it now has an eye-watering $US9 trillion ($13 trillion) to retrieve. That, effectively, will amplify the impact of rate hikes. Instead of buying up US government bonds — as it was doing during the GFC and pandemic — it will be selling them, mopping up cash and pushing interest rates higher. Mounting deficits, a mountain of debt, an overstimulated economy and ill-disciplined spending all await incoming prime minister Anthony Albanese, writes Ian Verrender. That will also cause bond prices to continue tanking, which will continue to weigh on all asset markets and on your superannuation fund. Until last week — when the US Fed rammed through a triple rate hike in one go — it seemed as if the retreat on financial and property markets would be relatively orderly. However, with another triple hike expected next month — followed by doubles in September and November and singles in December, January and March — orderly isn't the adjective that readily springs to mind. The only thing that might cause the Fed to back off and chill out a little is the prospect of recession, which is not really a comforting scenario.

118,analysis: No let-up to share market sell-off as recession fears build,business,"  No let-up to share market sell-off as recession fears build There are some heavy emotions attached to the share market, aren't there? Emotions like greed and fear, and the anxiety attached to uncertainty. This week has seen the Australian Securities Exchange swiped sideways by heavy selling. The benchmark ASX200 index closed Friday's session down 116 points, or 1.7 per cent, to 6,474 points. So, from its all-time high set in August last year, the Australian share market is now down 15 per cent. To be classed as a ""bear"" market, it will need to fall at least a further 5 per cent. So will it? And then what happens? Let's take a look. Global shares are down around 6 per cent, and Australian shares are down by around 7 per cent (as of Friday afternoon) on the week. Stock falls have been led by technology stocks and resources (miners), retailers and financials (banks). There are fears we could be on the verge of another global recession and investors are spooked. From their all-time highs last year or early this year, US shares have now fallen 24 per cent, and global shares have fallen 21 per cent. So, what's going on? It's actually painfully simple: global inflation is on the march up. In response, central banks around the world have raised interest rates. The US Federal Reserve decided to be quite aggressive on that front, raising its ""Fed Funds"" rate — equivalent to the RBA's cash rate target — by 0.75 per cent. It was the sharpest increase in its benchmark rate since 1994. Economists say the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates and that has the potential to push the economy into a recession. ""I now foresee a US recession within the next 12 months,"" BetaShares chief economist David Bassanese said. What about Australia? Well, National Australia Bank chief economist Alan Oster mentioned in a podcast this week he saw the chances of Australia entering a recession now at 30 per cent. But some, like AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver, think it's more likely than that ""We remain of the view that a global recession can be avoided, but with central banks now hiking rates aggressively, the risks have increased to the point that it's now close to 50/50,"" he said. Dr Oliver has seen his fair share of financial market movements. In his previous role as head of investment strategy at AMP Capital, he also oversaw over $1 billion in managed funds. He said it's too early to call an end to the current wave of selling. ""It's still too early to say that shares have bottomed,"" Dr Oliver wrote. Why? Here's the crucial point. Financial markets are speculating right now about how much damage rising rates will do to business bottom lines and therefore the health of the economy. We simply won't know how much damage rising rates have done, or will do, until companies announce their annual profits later in the year, or other official data is released. Until then, economists and market analysts will look for evidence, and any evidence they find that's not encouraging about the economy, will likely send shares lower still. There's a lot of emotional energy attached to these market movements too (worn by the traders), so the volatility we've seen in recent months is likely to remain. Not to mention the sheer volume of money being carried through the financial markets, and the stress attached to that. There's a lot a stake.
