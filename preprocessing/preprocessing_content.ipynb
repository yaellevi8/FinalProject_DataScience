    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Capitalization\n",
    "Sentences can contain a mixture of uppercase and lower case letters. Multiple sentences make up a text document. To reduce the problem space, the most common approach is to reduce everything to lower case. This brings all words in a document in same space, but it often changes the meaning of some words, such as \"US\" to \"us\" where first one represents the United States of America and second one is a pronoun. To solve this, slang and abbreviation converters can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Noise Removal\n",
    "Another issue of text cleaning as a pre-processing step is noise removal. Text documents generally contains characters like punctuations or special characters and they are not necessary for text mining or classification purposes. Although punctuation is critical to understand the meaning of the sentence, but it can affect the classification algorithms negatively."
